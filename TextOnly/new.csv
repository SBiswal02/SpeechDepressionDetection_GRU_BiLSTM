351,female,1,14,yes <clears throat> okay um new york um to pursue um music industry a job in the music industry  uh yes i'm self-employed um to become a music producer um it's pretty hard there's a lot of competition <laughter> um to pursue a job uh when um about a year ago last february it was pretty difficult east coast is a lot different than the west coast um i think i've been there twice in the past year no i'm more of a creature of habit um yes uh sometimes i feel like i don't fit into the crowd so um it's better just sometimes to be more quiet and view everything instead of uh you know going in and actively pursue things um <laughter> probably uh listen to music um and spend time with my dogs um <clears throat> probably um people being insensitive <insen> um not very um very nice to me or um seeing injustices or um i think that's about it <laughter> um pretty good you know sometimes <so> um probably couple of days ago um one of my friends was saying that um mm uh they were making a comment about how i am and i got kind of upset about that yeah it does <laughter> pretty close um my best friend so i um oh just one of my friends um i kind of am quiet about it and when a person pushes me to a certain point that's when i overreact usually um it's pretty hard um i rather the person notice that i'm kinda getting withdrawn and actively engage in me instead of getting it to the point where it's like um it it comes to a point where it blows out of proportion  um um probably spending time with my family in new york very close um my sister and my brother um i don't know they're just great people and i love them a lot and they're a lot like me so i feel like i have people that understand me um probably um i guess loyal um sensitive um <laughter>  i don't know it's kind of hard <laughter> it's a hard question <laughter> no no <clears throat>  yes gosh um i think probably nineteen ninety seven so a long time ago um i'm just uh during that time i was just going through a lot of issues and i was feeling unsafe to myself so i ended up going um to the doctor to kinda get meds and have therapy and stuff um not currently i i did about like six months ago um i just felt the therapist wasn't really helping me um i felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over and xxx she wasn't really challenging me and i've been in therapy for a really long time so i just knew it was a change it's okay <laughter> um yes i do actually um  when i feel connected to a therapist um and when i feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what i'm going through um so yes i do um i'm better at describing my emotions and feelings i think the biggest thing is um when i'm in situations eh i can see myself reacting one way and i take a step back and see how i can react normally almost in a way um    also i tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel like really bad about myself so it's nice to talk to someone that's not judging that doesn't really tell me like you know um they tell me it's o okay basically <clears throat> um feeling hopeless all the time not having you know enough energy to do things i used to like i had a little bit of concentration issues  um having weird disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind and just overall just feeling kinda crummy about life  um sometimes they are at  like random moments that if there's like a problem with like my interpersonal life or something like that or if i sometimes even seeing something on television um like sometimes that affects me  um listening to music or trying to distract myself um trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal to record things <clears throat>  um it's been a tough transition to come here so uh well being <be> being here um so um kinda half and half okay and not okay <laguhter>  um i feel like i've been a little bit with more withdrawn lately um but that's about it um <clears throat> some days it's great some days it's not um more recently it's been a little bit more difficult um i don't know why i have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night <clears throat> so i tend not to sleep very well and i wake up quite frequently during the night <clears throat> um <clears throat> very groggy in the morning and um that's about it like during the day i tend to yawn a lot and my friends always are like oh why are you yawning so much are you disinterested <disisinterested> in what we're doing and then trying to tell them it's not that at all <laughter> um probably christmas time when i was with my family  um just really happy and um feeling like everything was alright in my life  having a good sense of like where i was at that moment being present with myself um probably you know um let's see that's a hard question i think probably i can tend to read people kinda well sometimes and um  uh i like to say uh i'm good at like being a good friend to people being a good family member um i'm a hard worker when i do have a job so <laughter>  um um sure i mean it's life so of course there's regrets um one that comes to mind is um the wish that i don't eat as much so i can be a lot more healthy <laughter>  um don't take things so seriously <laughter> um enjoy being youthful and um i think that's it <laughter> um i don't know that's a good question probably um my previous job and my employment i worked really well with kids um  so i did a great job at that i was um a researcher um at a hospital and i helped a lot of kids out for about six years so seven years  yeah it was awesome um i was really kind of like um  reading people and so i decided to major in psychology <clears throat> so uh and then i went a worked in a um mental health facility and did research um with them with um with drugs and depression and things like that so it found like a good niche for me <laughter> okay no problem <laughter> goodbye <laughter>
455,female,0,1,<synch> yes very well uh ohio mhm uh finished school and came out to start my life uh not often now not really often uh because my parents have both passed away and so that's my reason for that was my reason for going home prior uh there's really not a comparison you know this is warm and sunny and that has four seasons so it's a very different environment i it took a minute to get adjusted to the different culture but uh after i was adjusted you know the sunshine keeps you here uh i love the weather i love the fact that i have the ocean and the mountains and um so many things that i can choose from and the diversity that i find here uh i tend to not have things that i don't like uh because where i am i know that i'm finding myself there so and i like me so that means that there's really nothing i don't like yes i do uh i love being able to explore different cultures be able to meet different people have a different set of experiences and at the same time to be able to find the commonality between uh all types of people it's a very rich experience um which one to where uh i guess i'm thinking about egypt and the wonderful experiences that i have there uh as i go the people and the warm and loving experience i have the knowledge i get to pursue through the exploring the temples and the pyramids etcetera things like that there are so many there really are but i can think of uh seeing a baby in a mosque which was just really pure and it really stayed with me how similar we actually all are um that's probably one of the things that i remember most from one of my very first trips uh there and let's see just the interaction of the people the food you know incredible i love the food too wow i've studied lots of different things i've studied law i've studied um entertainment i've studied communications i've studied whatever i want to quite a renaissance woman <laughter> <laughter> ah it's just always been my way to really explore all of the things that i enjoy keeps me fresh keeps me happy keeps me alive and um just allows me to be able to be fully developed as a human being being able to do that mhm um i don't have a dream job per se what i do have is a um desire to just be able to be free to do whatever it is that i choose on a daily basis so uh probably more outgoing mhm <laughter> well i start my day out very relaxed because i start my day with meditation uh and several <s> uh several other spiritual practices that i perform before i move uh around i get exercise so that uh i keep everything humming everything moving and uh then move forward from there uh excellent <laughter> i don't really have one anymore argued um cannot remember the last time that i actually had an argument um don't know what it's about i imagine that the last time i argued about something probably might be related to money situation i wish i had handled differently you know i try to take each experience as they come and try not to have regrets to hold guilt about the way anything uh went because they're all for me very positive learning experiences uh that i get to explore who i am through so i don't really see them as needing them to be different i need to learn from them or to um just really accept what is mhm hardest decision i've ever had to make um don't really have a quote on quote hard decision you know because i grew up in a way uh where my mother was extremely wonderful in the way that she always taught me to know that it was my own life and so she would never make decisions for me she always taught me to say she would always say it's your life and so um for me decisions don't really come as difficult to make they're pretty easy to make because i've been making them since childhood so i don't really have a most difficult decision i've ever made mm event that i could erase from my memory i don't really have one that i can think of that would be so terrible that i would need to erase it again everything for me is a learning experience so there's nothing really to regret or erase uh very easy as soon as i hit the pillow i'm out uh great uh a little more uh physical exertion than normal  but uh still great <laughter> mm no not overall but again i attribute that and i accredit that to the spiritual practices that i perform on a daily basis that keep me pretty even tempered no mm no uh that's pretty much every day <laughter> i feel really happy every day i'm thankful i'm grateful for my life and uh i'm just thankful for everything that comes into it uh very smart uh very loving uh very intelligent funny uh outgoing that's probably probably what my friends would say uh there's really nothing that i think i need <laughter> to to do or to have or to be different uh about myself like i'm okay with everything the way it is really am <laughter> what advice would i have given myself ten or twenty years ago to know um to understand that everything that happened ten or twenty years ago was important in terms of developing the person that i am now and so to just be able to go with the flow and go with the experiences of life in order to be able to learn how to move effortlessly through any situation that comes up recently really enjoyed uh uh cooked a very wonderful meal um 'cause i love cooking so that was something i really enjoyed mhm wow my my willingness to get to know myself through travel through exploration through practices and through the practical application of everything that i've learned about people cultures places and most importantly you know the god within me bye
411,female,0,0,I was just wondering if she doesn't look like anything like the actual yeah like a virtual reality thing yeah  k  okay k  okay when I'm done okay  and please  are you okay with this  pretty good  New York  I moved to LA in the 70s  but I asked you what I lived a lot of different places  I guess every few years but I travel a lot so I've lived in I've lived in Africa is Lyft in Spain Switzerland Hong Kong 2  what do you enjoy about  different cultures food music rituals of everything the smells of colors makes you feel alive  excuse me  one of my trips  I lived in Kenya for about a year I'd say I love horseback riding so when you're viewing other animals when you're kind of Disguise in the scent of a horseshoe can approach the animals a lot closer so it was great seeing red orange ball sunsets and riding along you know seeing somebody animals yeah  in Kenya  probably when I went to a  messiah Village and I happen to I used to live in Hawaii and I had been to Tahiti and I was wearing one of those perils that are hand-painted and I had it tied over the left shoulder with the Twisted one or not and I happen to enter a Maasai Village for the first time that day and I looked all around in the men were wearing their clothing exactly what the same Twist on the same shoulder and they came over to me and they said why are you dressed Maasai and  and then they came back and gave me what appear to be some very large what looks like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings and they would have liked Wade my ears straight down and and then gave me some bracelets and then they had me wear something around my waist in the city now you look proper Maasai  so but I I just I have a lot of fun I think living getting a chance to live in different countries around the world I'm just you feel alive all your senses are completely you know I woken yeah  I think it's not so clear-cut I think a lot of people's are a hybrid of both I mean I think I can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely Brazen and very courageous and other times probably one of my best virtues is I'm very gutsy person so when I really feel passionate about something I Risk Everything To Go Achieve it sometimes I believe that  usually will I make decisions very quickly and I find that I have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he said to me tell me how I can make decisions quicker and I told him I said well and that you should case you always have no choice in this is what do you mean there's hundreds of choices and I said not really because it's got wise is only one and it doesn't really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy mental energy reflecting all of it when I get why she always know what the choice were you really want to do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a 98% chance of failure even if it's a 2% chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield your joy so I always go to that ass tits to me a waste of total time and energy to even think about another Choice cuz who cares if you remain unscathed but it wouldn't yield to no joy  sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not  Departed  you said you put your fish  what do I do when I'm annoyed  I don't want to annoy sometimes like it's because sometimes I can have like it needs to be a little more patient  I guess you really have to put yourself  and somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy  how hard is it  not really I think that's the reason why I enjoy traveling so much cuz you're putting other situations where you're forced to to understand other people's lives a lot more regardless of how different they are from your s different situations I've been to so many third world countries and lived in so many different situations that helps create that which is why travel is really the best education there is  when was the last time  my sink  last time I argued about something  go try to remember  oh is he goes when somebody didn't respect actually my privacy and something  oh I know what it was  it was somebody who belong to the  Scientology face  I inherited  I inherited possibly of a immune disorder from my mother my mother died from lupus and I sometimes even right now I had like skin rashes welts and everything and I am very photos sensitive and  I had an you know what episode where was I had a big flare up and I wasn't really feeling well I felt flushed and everything and the scientologists tells me that I needed to be audited and and he said something about are you aware of past lives and I had told him that I was Buddhist and I was kind of curious that if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed be able to talk to them and he said that are you aware of that about something in your past and I go yes I believe that many religions including buddhism's and Scientology believe that things that you have  had in your history sometimes a statue or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness resulting from even your past relationships or your parents can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and we also believe I said that you know that you had the power of each person as a god-like or Buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself even when I'm on the verge possibly and I probably get one cold maybe every 15 years I don't have a tendency to be sick at all and a large part of it as I think when I think I'm on the verge I take the sort of like and I did this even when I was a child when I was seven I would fall down I have my boo boo and I would say I would say I would have two good part  you know help the bad part of a simplistic way in terms of a child and I would actually even when I was in a very severe car accident where I got cut by glass my whole back I contradict healing an enzyme when I went back to the hospital the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that she has hers last week or back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so I believe that but  but I was just I think I'm annoyed and irritated because the scientologists told me that because he had taken 20 or 40 courses and he had the certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and it wasn't even matter I said of whether he was really took 20 40 courses of whether I've been practicing Buddhism whether it was for 5 10 15 20 years of weather of somebody been practicing some type of Christianity for 50 years and Benny sitting in a church pew every day doesn't mean a person could have never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has you know so I just was thinking that is the antithesis of  somebody who says they were lighting but it's just the way I guess he kept grabbing his  you know his face down my throat that after while I was pretty patient with a but then who it was so Papa's that I became irritated  especially when he kept telling me that I was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery the following week and I didn't point it out him cuz I just didn't want to get into it but one could say hey you have a bad hip cuz you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn't need to get hip surgery I mean I believe to some extent things that can be caused by people themselves and then he flippantly said while you wear a Scientologist believe that past lives can also affect you know what I'm thinking to myself Buddhist of all religions  kind of like well known for being believing in in a cause and effect and past life situations and I found my thought you should really read up if he's trying to convert other people from other religions so but you know I die you know I I I just didn't you no care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it  but other than that I mean I don't  sometimes to have a little more tact I guess when when in terms of patients  I can think of that right away I guess disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital  I'm sorry  how did you do  my brother was supposed to be the strong and supposedly because he is in the medical field so my sister and I said well you know he's a medical one so he's probably used to seeing this all the time but it turns out he was the weakest one and even after you know my boss my father kept me know you know bucking these body would actually be fighting the artificial respirator and what kind of things you see all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was just very hard but you know I was after while the  you know even the Physicians and even the pastor from that particular you know hospital they said that he was no longer like even if he was to awaken from that he did his brain function would have been you know legible  that was  tell me about Nevada  I don't think I really have that many things that are that traumatic that happened to me that I've  had to block them I really don't know what it is within my makeup which  doesn't make me feel like I need to like I don't keep the I have friends that have on mitigated issues which they're not even aware of that affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger their hatred or their fear and for some reason I feel blessed that I don't have to like I can't really even think of something that I mean I've had some bad situations happen to me but it's not that the some reason they traumatized me in effecting you know my behavior where I would wear I block at that I'm not aware of something or I hold residual negativity for some reason so I really can't think of anything I mean does bad things that happen I know that they are but it's not like I feel like a necessary for me to block them because I've been able to  you know  chaps that sometimes they were unfortunate things that happened  pretty easy I can usually make my sleep by Self sleep in any situation if I have a 1 hour flight to San Francisco I could just kind of lean against the window where the pillow have a blanket over and even on our flight pass out before the plane is even taking off from the ground so I can I have literally when I've had little sleep and I very at high energy so I don't really need that much sleep but say like if I'm in Africa and I  Bobby potholes unpaved Road and I still need side I need a few moments of sleep I was just prop something up put my elbow against the window and say I think I should take a nap for 15 minutes go like this and through the jostling I could just take a nap for 15 minutes so I don't really have that problem  okay pretty okay me and I could deal without the skin flare-ups but you know from the photosensitivity and all that but other than that I'm pretty good spirits  have I ever studied what  I can still couldn't hear you I'm sorry  have you noticed any changes in your  I've ever studied changes in my behavior was the word  enough  I know I just with friends and everything just even this past week just seeing friends that I enjoy being with and just having great meal laughing just having a good time listening music  designing your address  regret about my entire life you man or are you talking about just recently or what are you talkin about  you know what's funny I find that lot of the negative experiences that are in my life that have happened are falsely been  opens up experiences that are  that are also great that I have not overlooked root sample I got totally ripped off by my business partner to the tune of my old my whole savings ever had to start all over again and sometimes people say to me like are you sure you're okay or are you just pretending to be okay or are you angry do you want to seek revenge if I was there cuz my business partner essentially ripped me off we knew each other's families which was even more difficult in a way and he still essentially my whole life savings essentially in a way and tea what got sent to prison or the FBI was involved in her pulse involved I was living in Switzerland and my father was sick and I was going back and forth and  but you know if I hadn't get involved hadn't gotten involved with him and business I wouldn't have had there a lot of Rich experiences and I think sometimes the reason why  I don't know why I'm such a positive person but for some reason I'm able to this not that I'm purposely trying to I do see the positive this and even harmful situations I wouldn't have gotten to live in Barcelona and Zurich I wouldn't have learned to speak as good Spanish Drummond lived in in Europe if I had not got involved in business with my business partner end up ripping me off but and there's a lot of other experiences a different friendships that I developed during that. Of time and in a way it was a total different life a different world that that would do you know that I would have never  have the chance you know to live through if I had not been filed in my ear but of course it cost me financially and but then again I've always been a type of person who your money isn't everything and I think the one I least cared about money is when I made the most of it so there you go and resemble one of my favorite  times in my life probably when I lived in Kenya and you would think that you know a lot of people have this really bad Vision or maybe looking living in mud dong Huts or something and living very primitively I mean it's not like that at all that I and you think that with the least amount of technological innovations and stuff like that I mean actually and I'd really didn't have you know that much been many material Goods to the time I mean I had the blast I had probably been one of the best years of my life when I was living in Kenya  that's so good to hear  what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  the same thing that I did probably when I was about 15 or 16  to live your life with passion and again like shoes the way I was saying earlier about making decisions you have to make those decisions. Wise what will give you a sense of on wonderment what will make you give you Joy and you have to its regardless what the percentage are even if you only have a 1% chance of success you have to go to sad cuz that's the only thing that will yield you know the happiness in your life  Otterbein your life  the fact that I've a two-year to that and been Brazen whatever you want to say have the balls of cuts / like a harness to go ahead and follow my passions and you know I guess people called me somebody strong decisions usually this isn't sorry when you where you remain unscathed usually don't heal Joy that's just Murphy's Law Office just the way it is  okay I think I've asked everything I need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me  hi

382,male,0,0,<synch> sure i'm doing fine i'm from columbia south carolina yep uh two thousand four yeah <laughter> uh once a year for christmas break uh a lot slower paced more xxx i wanted to perform <perf> to pursue a film degree or i'm sorry a film career yes it's pretty challenging but it's uh fun uh i've always had a interest <inter> interest in uh film and movies so uh it seemed like a natural pick for me uh took about a couple of years but uh i feel like i'm pretty used to it now uh i like that uh it doesn't snow it's warm weather and there's lots do to with a lot of beaches uh the traffic and the cost of living is pretty high <laughter> i've never been outside of the u_s but uh i would love to at some point uh it depends on the situation i i can either be introverted or extroverted just given uh the right circumstance i like uh listening to music uh doing crossword puzzles reading and hanging out with friends on weekends uh very good hmm uh i don't think it was argument maybe <may> maybe a difference of opinion so it was more like a debate but uh it was pretty pretty tame uh i think it was a debate over sports over a basketball <ba> a basketball game and uh i was talking on facebook with somebody about it but i think it's good to uh express yourself if you have a difference of opinion it's uh it's natural to you know not always agree on things so i think talking <ta> talking about is healthy <hea> is healthy i have a very good relationship with my family um i get along with all of my family members and extended you know cousins and aunts and uncles so uh there's no one that i i've ever had any rifts with hmm with my family hmm i probably could've been more disciplined growing up and more uh more disciplined with schoolwork and homework that kinda thing but for the most part uh i had a i had a good childhood and uh there's not much i would change about it hmm probably leaving my comfort zone in uh south carolina moving out here that was pretty hard but at the same time it was uh exciting so it was it was a bittersweet feeling um a lot of excitement mixed with uh some anxiety but it uh it went away pretty quickly sure not doing better in school uh when i was in high school uh definitely i could've been a a <ss> um more diligent worker and i could've uh applied myself a little bit better hmm i've always had a strong support <s> uh family support system and uh parents and uh siblings so that's definitely a positive thing hmm an event uh probably going back to school i wish i would've uh wish i would've done better in school so if i could take something back from my past it would be uh scholastically <sch> scholastically related it's pretty easy when i don't sleep well um i tend to be kinda lackadaisical and uh just tired throughout the day kinda groggy uh no everything's pretty much uh the way it usually is with me i've been feeling pretty good uh no i have not uh no i haven't last time i felt really happy um i made a lot of money uh a few weeks ago and uh i feel like i'm ahead of the game with you know with having rent under control and a lot of bills out here so i'm still kinda have the lingering effects from that happiness yeah uh when i when i have money i tend to be a lot uh more even-tempered not even-tempered but i tend to feel better about things and more optimistic and this city being such about your finances it it always makes you feel good to be ahead of the game and to have uh xxx have sources of income uh i think i'm creative and i think i'm a good listener hmm to be as disciplined and focused as possible because once you're out of your parents' homes and out of their lives you have to depend on yourself and the better the better you do in school and the better you are um uh as far as discipline's concerned the more pleasurable <pleasur> pleasurable your life will be and a lot eh uh your life will be a lot easier hmm let's see here i wish i was more disciplined but i'm working on that and i've gotten a lot better at that it's become pretty easy i think i'm just getting older um i'm out of my twenties now so i definitely seen a change from when i first came out here hmm um some people tend to say that my decision to move out here was uh not feasible and kind of a pipe dream so that kinda made me feel bad but uh i kinda take insults in stride and um sometimes i welcome constructive criticism 'cause some some things are wrong with you that you're not aware of so as long as it's not mean-spirited and it's coming from the right place i think it could be an invaluable uh tool you know listening to what to what other people have to say that might be negative hmm uh probably optimistic and um outgoing optimistic and uh helpful my ideal weekend uh i would love to go to vegas and have a road trip with with three or four friends you know packed in the car and just uh lots of disposable income and um you know good weather uh i haven't been to vegas in probably five years but um i've gone to casinos with my brother and that's pretty fun sometimes uh i'm proud that i've come a long way from when i first moved out here i'm uh a lot more disciplined um i read a lot uh i do crosswords and i think i've i think i know what's important in life now and i'm more focused and going after what i want hmm i'm not a big fan of high taxes um but it doesn't really make me mad it makes me frustrated and and uh i guess i take it in stride though uh i had a friend over at my apartment and i watched a movie and that was fun it was a documentary a sport <s> a sports sure goodbye

376,female,1,12,hashemite hair you see what you look like oh my God  all right now  so this picture is not based on a real woman at all  okay so when she said I'll just wait for the buttons not working and I'll come back to you okay  hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today  creative  yes  I'm doing okay it's still morning so  I'm from the East Coast Massachusetts  yes  I moved to LA when I was a child with my parents pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter  I haven't been back to the last time I was back there was that three years ago for Christmas  LA's very hustle-bustle there's a lot of people that are angry and a lot of people don't care about the other person here in LA and which Becky is the East Coast that the thought pattern is a lot different you know your neighbors are friendly to your neighbors and Tammy way that you see in the street  so yeah  well since I was a kid I was fairly young at first it was rough I was getting in trouble a little bit in school but after all that surpassed I did fine in high school and stopping even took some college courses  well I love the beach and I love the mountains I like to go hiking and I like walking along the beach I just live a few blocks away from the beach so it's easy  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes  do you travel  no not at all  it's not interested I've been to Mexico a couple of times when I was younger went to Ensenada but other than that I'm not interested in leaving United States especially with what's been going on lately overseas  okay  actually child psychology and I was in the nursing program for a little bit but I had some problems at home which caused me to drop out  that's right  I don't have one to be honest I admire people that are doing the job that they love I mean like football players they love playing football and they get paid all that money I'll grade is that so  I'm pretty outgoing when I meet somebody at first I might be a little bit reserved because we all when we meet somebody pass judgment as to if we want to continue communicating with the person or not but once I decided I like that person or whatever I I talked a lot so  hey  yes  I like watching movies I like I used to like reading but lately my concentration level hasn't been so great so it's hard to get into a good book  not good at times I have a  some Outburst every once in awhile to say depends on how angry I get  I yesterday and it was with my partner and actually be honest I don't remember what it was about It's just sometimes people can have an ugly attitude and I don't appreciate that and if I feel that I'm being disrespected or whichever I'm going to stand up for myself  at times some people may be turned off for my personality because very opinionated and I say what I say what's on my mind I do not purposely going to hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature but I won't be bullied and I won't be may I Won't Back Down if I feel like I'm being challenged so  last year my mother died  so  I wish I handled that differently  it up to it that upset me  so  tell me about  I think I'm going to pass on that one too because that'll upset me more  that is terrible sometimes I sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem especially you know when you're done working and doing everything that you have to do in a day you're tired but staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because it's like I can't I get up and then I'm wide awake I'll go out and living room turn on the TV and watch TV I'm lucky if I get 3 to 4 hours sleep  are they triggered by something  maybe because I do have a lot of my mind you know thinking about bills and the stressfulness of work and in all this other stuff so that's probably a big burst part of it  but it's not difficult it's just frustrating cuz when your mind goes on overtime mode it I just affects everything your concentration your sleep you're eating  everything so  I don't look grouchy especially in the morning I'm not a morning person I like the nights but I don't like the morning that's like leave me alone until I get my first cup of coffee so other than that I'm okay  well I've been I've been depressed for quite some time and I'm still having difficulty cuz after my mother died four months later my uncle died so I had two deaths last year so I'm still reeling and trying to  get myself back together just recently I've started pursuing like interest that I used to do that I haven't done in a year because of what happened  I just I might get angry little easier I sleep alot I eat I overeat  I get tired very easily cuz I'm not getting much sleep so sometimes it's hard it seems like I'm struggling to get through the day  yes I have a psychiatrist that prescribe me medication on a regular basis  oh I was diagnosed quite some time ago probably 10 to 15 years ago and it's just something I've never gotten over I don't know whether or not you can so I've always taken the medicine  I was  arguing with everybody in my family my friends and stuff like that and I was feeling desperate and hopeless and I had attempted to take my own life years ago which caused me to be hospitalized and then they start treating me I start seeing a therapist so  well right now I'm not going to a therapist because my insurance will cover the psychiatrist and a therapist but I am working with a friend of mine who had no some Avenues to go to seek help for a therapist and I don't know if that's really going to help me I mean sometimes it depends on what kind of therapist you get sometimes people just sit there and they just listen to you talk and Ramble On and you're thinking my God what good is this and the other type is the type that will give you some kind of feedback as to how to deal with the emotions tools to help you deal with your emotions  tell  change it  they said I haven't been going to therapy recently just psychiatrist medication  there's been no changes really  I probably would be doing fine because I was doing great before my mom passed away I was her caregiver and  even though a lot of times I filled I felt overwhelmed or lacked patience with her I still was a heck of a lot happier  then I am now  tell  I would say when my son was born years ago  do you find it easy to be a parent  I'm not a parent anymore he passed away  so  and that was difficult as well  I'm extremely organized extremely reliable my work loves me because I get everything done that I'm supposed to get done even though sometimes I feel a little scatterbrained and  you know those qualities are are admirable and people that can keep their word and and be responsible  excuse me  oh I have lots of regrets  things that I've done in the past I'm not too happy about but you know I met somebody once in my life that had had that saying and you see it on a bumper sticker live to never regret so you know you can't go back and make changes it's too late so why you don't dwell on the situation but this is what I'm just a lot easier said than done  I'm at the advice kind of get person you know I don't really  give my friends ain't kind of advice I mean  I find most of the time people don't listen to you anyway so why bother I just State my opinion that's all  what right now I'm on a diet because of my overeating after my mom died I was a lot thinner when she was alive I just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot and I'll sleep eat sleep to eat and so now I'm kind of like on a diet trying to lose this weight his very unhealthy for me  I think it's been a long time  actually there's really nothing because now I just keep my mind busy I haven't been to a movie in ages I don't I used to go out shopping all the time I don't now so it's been it's been quite some time since I've been content and happy with who I am and what I'm doing in my life right now  spend your ideals  my weekends like on Saturday I'm usually working on Sunday is usually clean up day you know do your laundry clean up the house  run some errands go shopping for food you know that kind of thing so it's not if I was younger you know it would be fun you know got clubbing or whatever but I'm too old for that now  really there's nothing that I can think of  there's nothing that I can be proud of  set a good like comedy or whatever I like to watch that  sometimes my partner

448,male,1,18,<sync> yes doing pretty good oh i was born in uh brooklyn new york i came out here when i was seven and i've been here ever since uh i don't consider myself anything but a californian <laughter> uh i'm a welder um i just i don't know something about it making and um building things and repairing things that intrigued me and uh uh i was actually pretty good at it so i stuck with it and and that's my profession <sigh> gee i really never had that i've just uh <sigh> kind of always uh hoped that i would have a job that could support myself and my family and uh i was satisfied with that well uh i just recently lost my uncle and uh he raised me since i was seven years old and uh other than my wife i don't have any more family um he passed away last uh july and uh i'm starting to get over it um i knew the day would come but he was my last living relative so i've been depressed about that and uh uh but i'm doing better it depends on the atmosphere um if i'm around people that i don't feel comfortable with i'm kinda reserved but uh if i'm comfortable and uh i feel like i fit in well i'm outgoing <laughter> <laughter> right i enjoy old movies uh old uh well it's called film noir and uh i love those old black and white movies and i get on netflix or amazon and i try to pick a movie that's uh from back then people were different than they uh i don't know it's just a different era and i enjoy it <sigh> well my wife says uh i probably not as good as i think i do but uh i've got to admit sometimes i lose my temper and it is according to her over things that i shouldn't be losing my temper about but um i'm working on it and uh i have basically had this problem ever since i was a young child oh yes <laughter> uh i've uh been in and out of trouble with the law when i was much younger i'm i'm passed that point now but uh <sigh> you know when you're young you think you know everything and uh you know you're never gonna get old and the future doesn't matter but uh it does matter because everthing that you do when you're young uh follows you for the rest of your life and i don't regret things that i've done but if i could go back i definitely would make different choices uh me and my wife we we <w> we don't argue we <sigh> disagree and it's she's very strong willed and she's a match for me <laughter> so uh we go back and forth but you know we don't get violent and we don't uh uh say meanful things or hurt each other we're just she is a determined strong willed woman and <sniff> i am who i am so we kinda go back and forth and lately i have been the one to <sigh> bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because uh in the long run it's just her and me and there's nobody else more important to me um <sigh> <tisk> when i was younger i wish that uh i didn't follow some of the people that i followed and what i mean by that is you know running in a circle with certain people and having an ego bigger than my common sense and um that's what got me into trouble <sniff> i was an only child and uh i kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and um getting the girls to laugh or having people mm think i was you know cool or whatever you wouldn't think that now i'm kinda overweight and balding but when i was in my twenties i was a a completely different person and <sniff> if i would've had some brothers and sisters i may not have thought or acted that way but i was an only child so i you know ran where people thought i was cool and that got me into trouble hardest decision i ever had to make was giving the authorization to um have my uncle pass away he was on life support and his kidneys had failed <sigh> and um doctors said there was nothing more he could do and to not have him <sigh> go through any suffering to let him slip away and as you can see i get very upset my uncle raised me like his own son and never let me down <sniff> and he's gone and for lack of a better word to push the button i never thought i would have to do that <sniff> but as i said i'm getting over it and um things are getting better slowly my wife she is uh always there for me <sniff> she will <laughter> always surprise me we she's not my wife she's my best friend <sniff> and she <laughter> knows me better than i know myself um <coughs> we enjoy uh uh doing simple things it's not that we can't do other things if we wanted to but we <sniff> mesh um <sniff> we enjoy each other's company uh we like the same things and uh we you know occasionally go out and do something together but we <clears throat> we just enjoy each other's company and she like i say knows me better than anybody and um it surprises me sometimes mhm you know <sigh> lately well i can't say lately <sniff> if i don't <coughs> excuse me if i don't do a rigorous activity or something that really uh stresses me or strains my body it it let's say for a couple of days i'm just very relaxed and you know not doing much i i just automatically get up after four and a half five hours i mean and you know my wife will say you know guy you're not getting any sleep but i mean i don't feel tired i don't feel exhausted i don't feel like i need to go back to sleep i'll stay up all day and i'm fine and most people would say that's not enough sleep but you know for me i'm it doesn't affect me <sniff> well i wish some things could be different but uh i'm not dissatisfied <sniff> um uh i'm happy with my life uh there there uh like with anybody else there's a few things that i wish were different and i think that's in anybody everybody else's uh you know life but um <sniff> i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm content yeah i feel a little less motivated <sniff> um recently well i can't say recently this was back in january um my wife and a few uh friends were noticing that i was um becoming forgetful and i i couldn't remember things i i didn't see it and um you know when they when everybody brought it to my attention then i started to but anyway i went to the doctor and um they gave me the tests and apparently i have m_c_i which is mild cognitive impairment and uh i've over the last month or so nobody has mentioned it to me i mean maybe i'm getting better but the neurologist that i saw <sss> is having me come back in a year and gonna retest me um hopefully it's not the beginning stages of alzheimer's i'm still a little young for that i'm only fifty <fif> fifty two but um i was diagnosed with uh mild cognitive impairment and uh it it could've been due also i was told by him uh because of the death of my uncle i could've been pretty depressed i was not able to retain things and so well i'm going back in a year and we'll see if uh i'm any better i'm sorry i'm not understanding you i'm sorry how <h no no i have not yes two thousand one um i was in a um uh what is the word i'm looking for <sniff> i was in a um in a state of mind of of where i was just going to get myself in trouble and and not benefit anything if i didn't seek any help um i was diagnosed with uh depression and anxiety disorder uh worrying and thinking too much about things and uh thinking the worst and uh i i take medication for that uh well <w> well you know it's not really therapy it's <clears throat> you know every uh few months you know you gotta see the doctor are you doing fine everything good and you know they just refill your prescription <laughter> it's you know it it's you know kinda like the next person next person it it's i i'm with kaiser so it's it's they'll talk to you but it they give you the impression that um you know i i okay let's move along you know they they'll <th> they'll hear your explanation but you know it it they don't have all the time for you that you may want so i i i i'm doing fine now if i really needed help i would i would do something the medication works for me <sigh> last time i felt real happy well it would depend on what the event is i'm always happy when i'm doing something with me and my wife and we're enjoying each other and i you know i'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and i don't have anything else she is my world but um i i i enjoy being with her and we're we we do things together and <sniff> i i i'm happy all the time when when we're doing that um <sniff> when i'm outside of that circle i i i don't know if this sounds right but i'm not seeking happiness i i can only explain it as i'm content i'm not um i i'm not disappointed or i'm not uh wanting anything i'm you know whatever comes my way is fine so well um <sniff> i don't know i i couldn't give you that answer <laughter> um <sniff> well my best friend is my wife but uh <sniff> she would um describe me as uh i don't think before i speak um i um let the littlest insignificant things bother me and i get angry over but the big things it's like i let it go and she's bewildered by that <coughs> um uh <vocal fry> years and years ago um she i had a uh classic uh pontiac lemans and she had gotten into a minor fender bender and she thought it was gonna be the end of the world 'cause that was my baby and i <sigh> you know hey don't worry we'll get it fixed and she was <w> she thought <laughter> that i was gonna hang her or something you know because that was my this was you know that was my baby and uh she goes you know you you get excited over nothing but you know i something like wrecking your car that you love and you've put so many hours of work into it and money you know it gets crashed and it's like you don't care so that's the only way i can explain it well i i need to lose some weight as you can see <laughter> i'm definitely uh been on an eating binge uh and uh the neurologist said that's probably due to the event with my uncle um i'm heavy <heav> i am this is the heaviest i've ever been in my life and i'm finding it a little bit harder um i i can't say harder but i'm i'm finding the will power to say no and to stick with it and to go exercise or you know not you know  movement now going maybe for a walk you know me and my wife when we were a little bit younger we used to love going for walks <clears throat> and we lived in a scrubbed_entry uh boy you know look at that wonder what's inside there you know that that's uh we don't do that no more i guess it's we're a little bit older now and <laughter> a little bit heavier it's harder to walk with all this weight <laughter> but i i i i wish i could change that because uh i i you know it's just not healthy the size <sigh> <sigh> uh lately no i don't regret anything lately um <sniff> everything's been fine the like i say the the biggest biggest impact in my life was the event with my uncle and uh i never ever in a hundred years or ever thought that i would face that situation and <sniff> i'll never forget it but they say time heals all wounds and and it does <laughter> don't listen to other people uh again i'm not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened but he used to constantly tell me to uh he would see the things that i was doing and the paths that i was going down and i constantly thought i knew better and i think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they um the young lady that i was talking to in here they think they're invincible and so did i <laughter> i figured ah i'm never gonna i'm never gonna have those problems um i wish i could've changed some things um <coughs> the history of my past follows me as it does everybody and that has limited me in in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that i'm able to do uh i don't miss them but if i could go back uh ten or twenty years i definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions that i made my welding certificates um i'm uh certified by the american welding society and i've uh <sniff> uh that's probably the biggest achievement that i've made for you know myself an accomplishment um <clears throat> uh people that i know say that i'm uh well i haven't been working on cars lately but they said that i have a natural knack for uh restoration and working on vehicles and i don't see it but i've been told that once or twice but i i've kind of i i've kind of started to slip away from that i don't i can't say it's from lack of interest but i just don't feel the motivation no more i wish i had a pocket of money and i'd have somebody else to it that's how i feel <laughter> okay well thank you bye bye
457,male,0,3,turn on yes  spectacular this is an interesting experiment  I am from middle of nowhere Iowa  May 2nd of 2007 so exactly 5 years at 6 years ago and frequently like once every couple years  the weather exist so it's more extreme and then it's exciting  winter in Minnesota  I took approximately  the drive-in that's that's about all it took the lights the lights took care of the rest  I really love that it's a giant concrete playground at night time so that bicycles have free reign of the streets I like all the art I love the fact that there's so many different kinds of culture jammed all together and then if you look hard enough you can find anything you really want here  oh you know the traffic the exceedingly High Cost of Living  I'm sure you can  not nearly as much as I would like to have been a little bit  I like not knowing exactly how things are going to go like the fact that it forces me to  deal with people to deal with situations in ways that I normally wouldn't have to  last year I got to hang out in San Marcos for a little bit after I split up with my ex and then after San Marcos I went back to Iowa for a bunch of family stuff and then I brought my little brother to Los Angeles  last week managed to go on a bike ride for ciclavia  as I use basically a Rolling Green Light the entire way down Venice Boulevard and so he made me made a bunch of like national news and was all over the place but the rest of us as his support group riding around on topics and stuff they we didn't bat an eye we didn't blank because it has normal for a friend that wasn't even the most absurd thing he's done lately I was just at a happy normal Sunday but our group of friends is so unusual that a normal Sunday for us is Extreme for everyone else  I used to be an introvert but definitely an extrovert the last few years thank you Los Angeles  once I found the right group of friends it was easy to be social it drew me to be social extroverted even outgoing  bombastic for the first time and it stuck  if I weren't already the most relaxed guy already I would probably do things but when I'm really stressed out I do all sorts of stuff  usually I tried to enlist my friends call me doing art project  what temper  panics cuz I really wanted to make him not hate me and I mostly failed  hard on him I mostly unless I got by with a couple of scrapes on my Hugo  when when that all went down I tried to talk to him but I got distracted for the very first time that day and so instead of  having my rubber gloves up I managed to take a whole bunch of words to the side of the head and fall over trash cans it was not my most graceful moment  something you feel guilty about  I feel guilty about lots of stuff I feel guilty about eating more often than everything else  because I really love junk food it's really good and I have very little food will power these to be that guy  tell me about the hardest  I'm not sure what the hardest decision I ever had to make was made a lot of hard decisions  I guess  it's very hard to leave Los Angeles after my ex and my best friend did a whole bunch of nasty stuff but I wasn't even that hard cuz it pushed me to do it so  tricky questions  oh you know Brooke collarbone severe pain get surgery on the LC like the time  tell me about  know my numbers are important I have lived a spoiled blessed life and if I changed anything then it wouldn't be the same universe I like this universe  little brother lives here he's awesome he's actually right outside waiting for me my mom is crazy and my dad is crazy everyone else is crazy I'm pretty crazy  but  since most of the rest of them live so far away and don't have to deal with them too much relationship is positive and sparse  jackrabbits been pretty positive influence Mi lately she is a magical creature  well there's a part where she's intensely physically beautiful is the part where she  manages to hit me with the best inspiration words there's the part where she  actually works on the exact things that make me excited there's the part where she pops in and out of my life at the exact right instance and then there's the part where she is 100% kind and caring all the time  all of those things are really nice but then when you add to that and compound it with the fact that  she does this all  without wanting anything in return  smitten  what a funny question how do I know them as though she's multiple people how did you know I know her through my  bicycle friends  the hard part is going to bed but as soon as I get to to sleep land time pretty much there until an earthquake hits so I can get to sleep  poorly but then I'm a pro at it so it doesn't matter  less verbose and that's about it my dark circles get slightly larger and I'm pretty much the exact same dude because I've been doing it most of my life  so stoked that I might as well be on fire  because the universe and its infant  I suppose the word is sardonic sense of humor has managed to convince me of the reality of magic in the Archer City Park Simon's ISO  as a fortunate and  vaguely aware being it's my privilege to get to enjoy more time like this  yeah my excitement is increasing at an almost exponential rate and feeling more and more inspired all the time if I could just work on the motivation I'm beside  have you ever been  not since you asked me on the phone a little while ago now  I know I used to think I had it but who knows at this point those while ago  I was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time and then I moved to Los Angeles and started having fun and then the rest is ancient history  2013  working on my shoes this morning was really nice doodling on our project that all my friends helped him put on that's that was pretty nice that's a nice feeling  awesome  a very good question I'm not actually sure I'll have some later today though  I guess I'm  Susie Astic I am  historic and I am  I'm going to have to say highly analytical  be nice if I could get my superpowers back would be pretty cool  like turning on some of the fancier finely-tuned and delicate Machinery that Chinese medicine has clued me in to inside myself  to play tough one I think the thing that I'm most proud of would probably be  I'm not actually sure  00 all sorts of stuff I'm working on that  don't masturbate so much  what are some things that you  Jackrabbit really bad puns and dessert  no problem  hi Ellie  okay  what a hoot
339,male,1,11,yes um i'm okay i was born in san bernardino california  yes um i'm staying with a sister in north hollywood um she makes it as comfortable as possible uh i love the weather and the entertainment and the public transportation um it's very difficult to find full time employment  and some of the people aren't as friendly as people from the south 'cause i lived in the south before um those are the only two things no i don't i was an english major in college i haven't finished yes i am um i'd like to be a recording singer yes um i've always loved to sing from the time that i was a child  at times um when i'm alone i am um extremely <sigh> i guess i would say um inter minded like i um have a lot of thoughts and i keep them to myself <clears throat>  so if i'm in that mode then i don't really um interact with people but i can also interact with people if i change modes um i just started doing yoga a couple of weeks ago and last week on thursday no on tuesday um  usually i just try to um remain quiet and listen to the situation if it's a person or if it's a situation <clears throat> that i'm dealing with myself that's annoying i try to um think of alternate ways that would make the situation better  um come up with alternate plans so i won't get annoyed um pretty good um mm i may have had an argument a few weeks ago um just about timeliness like meeting on time and showing up on time and it was actually last um monday yeah mhm no um to just be cautious of people's intentions and to listen really well 'cause people usually tell you what their intentions are without even um realizing <re> realizing it  um a good listener patient um fun loving generous um depressed sometimes um  but generally a good person no i have not yes um within a year and a half ago um i just knew that i often thought about situations that um happened in the past and kinda blamed the situation for my future and um um certain settings um if i  um see certain types of individuals in certain settings it just reminds me of when i was younger when things happened and changed my future plans so i um try to i used to just try to avoid those types of situations and certain types of people at that time but now i feel like i um just handle things better as far as um being in the similar settings with similar people i just i um handle those things better i do um i like to believe that it does i don't worry as much um it's just allowed me to know that actually speaking about the issues um relieves me of the tension of um holding them inside so that's how it's helped me at first it was difficult just being open with my internal emotions but now it um it actually is good because i know that when things are occurring  um if i'm able to um communicate about them with a certain individual it um relieves me of the stress of of uh trying to figure out everything alone and often times um by speaking about the issues it um allows me to come up with an alternative plan that may be be better just because i'm hearing myself speak of the issue  um i was diagnosed with depression and um my doctor felt that i should probably see the therapist um i am it depends um if i'm really busy during the week and have a lot of things to do i often try to plan things and if i'm planning things it affects my sleep i might wake up in the middle of the night so sometimes it's easy and sometimes it isn't irritable um very <v> just very irritable um i was feeling anxious but now i'm calmer um today i don't but i have in the past week um because i was in the midst of um searching for

Tell me about your kids I just have one daughter who graduate UCI law school and my Razor totally alone is that a house that seemed like an accomplishment that was was worth it to jobs in the work  I just died. I think you're pressure and can totally LOL dolls ready thing a parent is trying to put into a child.  Yeah  can you give me an example that you have a daughter for being a now at The Graduate law school when she even said we'd kept her in Beverly Hills schools and Asthma of those very wealthy kids with hearing name celebrity families whose white chocolate Jesse got in trouble for that one sitting and not because she wasn't influenced so that was a really bad time for us  what do you think I think it depends on which neighborhood or state you're in or are they the think there are little misguided as a little tired right now I can throw them away down by the concerns of the wars and and things like that and I think they could probably use that as a common goal a common in our now is he as a separate group that had once they were I think  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep I worry sometimes about work issues than pretty pretty easy do you feel that way often I don't feel like I'm not sleeping I just know Caitlin will worry about nothing work when was the last time that happened a couple weeks ago  how did you feel in that moment I just died you know unfortunately have to worry you don't unfortunate this is it easier to operate between people it's almost everything you know so you always want to have that around you  what are you like when you don't sleep well just stressed out stressed or unstressed  that sounds really hard  do you feel down and fatigue has a lot of your applications for just not feeling like yourself or Miss judging same as he might judge differently if you were arrested  have you been diagnosed with depression and not depression  have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD probably I was that was to consider the possibility of had an employment lawsuit several years ago and and actually litigated it and want to settle city of whistleblower thing and locations of that and contrast about it and so I found when I got out of it I couldn't find work right away in my feels I had to go into the field go back to you till I get a new and a professional Direction and I found myself fearful sometimes it's going to happen again and I need to make them  I'm sorry to hear that  what got you to seek help just that I was noticing that I was noticing that I was feeling very in my paralegal class I had a section about employment law and there was a very complicated filing I done with grape adult work and study for my case that once its face with it again in that class setting I just I just couldn't get it done I was late is a late paper for me and I realized it was traumatized by having to go through that again we have post-traumatic stress and I couldn't later after the adrenaline dies down the one I understand and so I think it was just stuff it was just kidding me later and I was having a face that paper again  just just extreme you know avoidance of getting something done it shouldn't easy for me and and thinking about it as thoroughly as I should ever studying at are putting it off and putting the feeling of going threw that paper that type of paper you have just a class assignment again  have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughtful  well I'm not lately you know back then for sure when that happened which is about ten years ago now with someone quarterback 7 years ago now and yeah it was it was effective I was affected the way you do most everything and your confidence in that kind of thing  I'm sorry repeat the question  a peaceful do I feel peaceful well yeah I was peaceful that it was settled that bit angry that it ever happened so it's hard to all probably not ever feel peaceful about that issue ever and always dimension of always makes me angry that I had to go through that  yeah he's done anything to avoid it I don't think so I tried everything to avoid it and so I think that's that was aggravating for me to get my patient person realistic and I'm and I tried everything to avoid a confrontation the matter but which is required to try to help me cover with the damage to our lives My Daughter's Eyes  do you consider yourself an introvert I am not now maybe one time in my life. Now you if you can't communicate you know you couldn't communicate can overcome people's perception if you can effectively explain something and it will help you overcome other perceptions of yourself that others might normally have judgements for age or anything like that yeah  which one of your most memorable experiences  what is raising a daughter extendedly in Aurora you know just experienced something to look thinking that was it after all the years that was a success her graduate from Law School  how did you feel in that moment I just  like a lot of work had a good everyday you know the happy glad that it was fulfilled was reserved for drains for this child were fulfilled you know that and she was able to make that  that's great  when is the last time you felt really happy  wow I am tempted to be kind of happy with life cuz the L turn it is going to harm it harm your email your ability to succeed so I try to force happiness I guess him in most every situation my life right now I find something about it when I lost some weight recently that made me really happy  you travel a lot I travel lolbit locally I travel more when I was younger I really enjoy that but just that you're busy the last few years  what do you enjoy about traveling just know places ability to take that worries we have every day work or concerns that you could have put them away for awhile and see something new to hear about all your trips and we're back to Colorado several years ago went through mail and then spent the night there and and it was during spring with our make skyr said it was just beautiful and very quiet by wrestlers with the decks and open in the mountains and the Beautiful  that sounds like a great situation  how your best friend describe you wow just a Darden some hardworking loyal creative  okay what's the best thing about being a parent  just seeing something that you're creating you're trying to create become something that you hoped picture would be you know if that's the case you know just a hard worker the Builder herbs that itself in a certain way that you know it makes you happy  yeah  how close are you to them my daughter pretty close to his head baby to the Bay Area 2000 pictures  that's great  okay I think I've asked everything I need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me okay goodbye  friends are so cool  set the recording.
416,male,0,3,never had that doesn't matter okay  start a conversation  okay  go back over here  when she said she'll let you know  hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment  and please  are you okay  sure  I'm doing good how are you  Chicago  yeah  about 25 years ago  yeah it's been a while  actually haven't been back I like Ally I like la  it's a big city so it's kind of similar but the weather is not the same so got to let la for the weather  family I was a child  you took a little adjustment but not hard  the weather can't think of anything right off the bat but I sure wouldn't want to leave so my family is here so that's another reason why I wouldn't want to leave  traffic  not really but I've tried to shove a little bit yeah  seeing new places different people the way they live their lives  my went to Monterey California earlier the middle of last year that was very nice  it's a good question I'm not really sure  probably  I can't think of anything right off the bat which makes me think it's kind of weird but  astronomy  yeah it was  I don't know just kind of fell into it took a course liked it and then took some more and I just went down that path  no  there is not much job opportunities  it's kind of limited  yeah it does  my dream job I would like to own a restaurant a nice butt bar restaurant  can you tell me about  I'd like to have something a little more upscale than most places you go to released in the area that I live in most places don't seem very kind of just seem like a dive bar just kind of worn out run down so something nice something different something creative something vibrant something for you know tracks of crowd  but it's probably cost Lisa I don't know if it's really possible  I'm definitely more shy but I can be outgoing when I'm comfortable with people that initially I'm pretty shy  good idea  a lot of times I try to just lay back and you know do some deep breathing just kind of clear your mind or maybe just watch a movie listening to music is good reading a book that is just takes your mind away relax  I've gotten much better at it I used to have problems with that when I was younger but I'm good I'm good with that now learned that you shouldn't react immediately to situations you should you think before you speak that type of thing  when was the  my ex girlfriend when we broke up about 3 months ago  we're relationship just wasn't doing very well so it just kind of was going down a predictable path and we just were arguing over the same old stuff and wasn't really it wasn't a memorable argument that it was it was an argument so that's all I can think of and I haven't really seen her since so that's what it is nothing special just a typical argument between two people who drowned separate  frustrated  like I guess everybody kind of sees things in their own way and do you know my way in my perspective is right and I'm sure her way was right too so trying to convince somebody that you love your ideas or what you're thinking is more difficult than it is because everybody's kind of looking out for themselves  oh yeah  that's a good example right there with the with my girlfriend I didn't have to I could have reacted a little differently and not shown so much emotion there's been times in my life where I got into arguments with friends or something like that were you know or previous relationships where I probably shouldn't have reacted the way I did you know not that I did anything bad but just more of a you know be more mature about not you know reveal your emotions so much for that type of thing  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had  leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when I was 18 is it a long time ago  I went to school in San Diego and I immediately wanted to come back so  I kind of ruined our relationship and we're still friends and I wish I didn't do that  what's something you feel guilty about  I feel like I can contribute more to my family and my friends like I think I could do better I think I sell myself short so  employment opportunities are hard to come by but if I can find a good job and be a lot more happy because I can provide for myself and others so not be so much of a burden to people around me  yeah real difficult  tell me about your relationship with  good very good we're pretty open with each other and I see my mom and dad and my sister quite often so it's good relation I mean we get along very well could be Demi is not perfect but it's good  pretty easy I'm a good sleeper  I'm probably irritable or harder to do tasks it's kind of like you feel like you're being strained or something because you don't have as much energy and  how did the feeling lately good relatively well spring time always makes everybody feel well  have you ever been tag guns with p  no not at all  never  really really heavy and you we all feel happy everyday at some point but really happy probably been a while  if I like Super Bowl Sunday I was with all my friends were having a good time so it's been probably like a month and a half or something when I was really really happy  I wish I was more  I guess  stuff to my goals and I wish I had better drive to succeed I don't know I usually settle for less  I don't know I guess that's the calm demeanor part of me that's good and bad  don't really matter I kind of live in the moment and then you kind of realize that 5-10 years ago on by and should have done something  I'm just going to stick to that argument with my girlfriend three months ago she made me feel pretty bad  tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory  I don't know when I was  when I was in high school I got into an argument with a friend and I drove my car too fast and it was an area that I didn't know and I hit a turn that I didn't know I was coming and I crashed my car so I wish I didn't do that but that's a long time ago so it's not a big deal now  stupid immature  my parents some of my close friends I have I have a good group of three or four friends they've been positive influences  caring guy nice person good heart  little little unmotivated needs to improve on certain aspects of his life to  make himself better and passionate I guess passionate in a good amp  I care a lot and it's the same time sometimes it gets the best of me  can you give me the  sometimes you feel like you know you're doing more for your friends or somebody like that  you're doing more than they deserve and you're not it's not being reciprocated  so that's an example  yeah probably but I can't think of anything off the top of my head  focus more in school because while you're young you have the ability to multitask and  something you did recently  I don't know really enjoyed I mean I do things everyday that I enjoy but really enjoyed I don't know  I cleaned up a bunch of stuff in my room so it's nice to shed some old garbage so that that was all right but don't know if I really enjoyed that I feel content after it  what are you most proud of in your life  how much it's makes kind of sad I don't know I think I could do better I feel like I'm Underachievers so I don't much I don't know  I'm very detail-oriented organized I like to finish tasks I care a lot and I'm very caring  I have good intentions in mind I don't like the wrong people I don't like to lie because once you buy one lie leads to another so I don't like that  but yeah that's that's about it  cool  right on have a good day  hey those weird I felt like I was in therapy  so take this offer
471,male,0,0,okay thank you  yes  I'm doing well thank you  from Los Angeles  sports Outdoor Sports mainly  surfing snowboarding mountain biking rock climbing  awesome awesome  traffic  yes  experiencing different cultures  well I love going to Mexico  and it's so much different from California and Western culture so to speak I know Mexico's a western civilization but the level of entertainment than the level of education is so much different than they're like two different worlds  traveling you mean  I would have to say going to an island off the coast of Fiji and the name is table Aurora and it's a very small island you can walk around in 30 minutes 30 or 40 minutes and it's a place where you go to go surfing and it is an incredible visually incredible and experientially incredible place  I studied biology  I was pushed from behind by my father who was a medical doctor and he wanted me to become a medical doctor also  not at all I'm working in areas of business now  yes I am  my dream job would be to be a missionary  yes  my father's initial objective when he became an MD was to become a missionary and the he's a very generous person and I think I am too I guess I got that from him hereditarily but I would like to help people and I don't think being a doctor is helping people I really don't I think it's disingenuous to say you're helping people while you're stuffing wads of cash into your pocket I would like to be building people homes and helping them find fresh water sources things like that if I could afford to travel to remote places like that  screensavers  I know it's not  what are you  my exercise  I think I'm pretty good at it. I think I'm pretty effective at it  it was probably two days ago it was my girlfriend and it was about her lack of consideration  I felt frustrated  a situation which I wished I could handle differently  in my later years I would say I don't have many regrets in my younger years I used to be snubbed by people and I would keep my mouth shut and I wouldn't say anything I would not express my displeasure of their actions or their behavior I would just keep my mouth closed and internalize my feelings I've learned that that is so wrong and so they'll probably the last 15 to 20 years I have made it a point to vocalize my displeasure with someone's actions right away and that takes care of the anger immediately  yes say it depends what you mean by trouble I think all the way around once you take the beginning the beginning to the end it diffuses trouble rather than prolongs or protracts the trouble  going back it would be to not to pursue medicine like my father wanted we argued at length for many months and years about this and finally I prevailed and I didn't go to I didn't go that route but that was probably the most difficult. In my life  there was a time when I wished I could erase a female interactions girlfriends than and their betrayals but now I realize that keeping those memories make me who I am today and and dealing with them defines who I am today  oh my parents are deceased I had very good relationships with my parents I'm very thankful for that even though my father was somewhat of a hard handed person we came to an understanding well before he died and my brothers I get along great with my younger brother but my older brother has issues he has psychological issues and they continue to plague him and to affect me also just just knowing that he's going through turmoil  well I guess I really don't cope with it because he's clinically depressed and he has Suicidal Tendencies and that he's not working he's very highly educated and he really doesn't talk to me and his family is very abusive towards him it's an I'm not a happy relationship for his family  yes  I know I would have to say my father my father is my hero he's my model he's my archetype for what a man should be use unimpeachably honest and kind yet on the other hand he was he had high expectations of me and my two brothers  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  usually it wants my head hits the pillow I am dead asleep like a log but lately I've been having just last night I couldn't sleep I woke up at 2 and I have a feeling it's because of a diagnosis of cancer that I received one month ago  with my own personal methods of handling stress I'm okay I'm probably 90% okay that 10% comes from a uninsured nurse about the future about whether I will survive this or not  not really  no  never  never  oh I was either surfing or snowboarding or rock climbing or mountain biking I always experience Joy when I'm exercising at a very high level of exertion  funny jovial intelligent perfectionist  that's no one's asked me much about that maybe  to submerge my  hedonistic self  I look at it once again and my father feels my Consciousness he was the ultimate dufur of gratification he put now behind him and he put what will be in the future in his sights and he never let go of that and that's what made him the self-made man that he was or as I am looking always for the present how I feel now and it's difficult for me to slog through a mile full of crap in order to get to a prize that is so far away  it would be  my ex-boss and he started using my last day of work when he fired me he started using a lot of profanity toward me and I turned to him and I said you cannot talk to me that way and he continue to use more profanity until I objected to it again and that's when he fired me and that still in my mind and that occurred a year-and-a-half ago  anything I regret oh yeah I regret not getting married and having kids  you've done anything to a boy  sure I suppose I could but I think that  that would have robbed me of the many opportunities I had and I took to travel around the world and experience different cultures because that's what I enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness because the United States is not the end of the world it is once you get to trouble you find out that we are not if we do not have the highest level of living in the whole world that other people think that we're the only ones that think that and I disagree  that's a good one I would say I would say to just enjoy life because you never know when it's going to end and I think I've done that and I may be coming to an end soon with this diagnosis of cancer so I think I've done I've I'm happy with my life thus far  I was giving a rock climbing lesson I have a part-time job of instructing rock climbing and many of these people have never done it before and they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this may have changed their lives so that was very gratifying to me  I would say my  Devotion to the environment I wasn't always an environmentalist but I have been vocal in the cause of being a steward of the environment because today there are a lot of people people that are polluting the environment with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septic things like that and I stand up and I have been on TV and on YouTube speaking up against these people that pollute the environment  thanks for sharing your thoughts with me and you're welcome  goodbye  it was interesting  okay
355,male,1,10,yes  alright  I was born in Los Angeles California  I want the weather and  the fact that the people aren't so obtrusive like on the East Coast  just the the traffic in the Smoky weather  I used to I'm unemployed now so I'm rarely go anywhere  I have a BS in business with a computer option  I thought that the only place I can get a job with a business degree was in accounting or in business computer message so I took that I took business computer math adoption  I probably be  professional sports player and actor something something that you enjoy doing  I like to ride my bike I like to watch sporting events now I can't afford to go to them so I pretty much watch on TV  I like to travel but like I said I don't have money for that anymore  that's all right  people who are chicken heads they getting their nose in other people's business even if they're just strangers expect that from a family member  where are friend but you know fishing with the internet that feeds a lot of that now we know what Orwell is referring to when he spoke the big brother in 1984  I don't do much him much different than I would otherwise  and I had many temper outbursts  girl you was my aunt  and it was because she was basically  making leading statements trying to trap me into saying something about a relative and if you don't know I'd me greatly  I'm kind of on the outs with my parents  the black sheep  I mean my Mom's done the most to help me she's done a lot you know more than anybody by far  well I mean she's just me one time when I was in like 15 I went with a friend of mine to see the Crosby Stills Nash and Young concert at the Forum and she has seven kids and she pick me up at the Sizzler is right across the street from the Forum at 11 at night and I couldn't imagine the others had to do that day that she agreed to do that but she did  oh probably  going down to the cape at the end of a Baja Peninsula and Cabo San Lucas or photograph in the bridal veil falls in Yosemite  I was by the two most majestic see sites I've ever seen  it was when I could afford to travel  no  no  I was diagnosed with depression after a hospital visit in April of 2011 and I took some Lexapro but I stopped after one day I didn't want to do it anymore  no  because I didn't feel it was help I feel I was becoming a zombie  yeah  depressed about not having a job for over two years I lost my job in October 2010 and except for you nose job like this which I'm fortunate to get just neon daily things focus groups like that I haven't worked  thank you  Ashley when you're 56 years old  well just get the general feeling of hopelessness  I get out of my bicycle out of walkthrough bikes 4 hours a day spent about 2 hours each  yeah it's good to me  very easy  cuz now I'm old when I was young I couldn't sleep more than 4 6 hours a night  cuz I'm Restless  are you triggered by something no  but now that I'm old I am I sleep much more easily  I pray before I go to sleep and that that's it that's when I can't have any trouble sleeping I just pray beside different prayers like the Lord's prayer Hail Mary stuff like that and I'm leaving to fall off to sleep  I don't know probably  you have any news Civic remembrances  I love that you know it was when I had money to spend I know that and when I had to have a job to have money to spend so it's probably 15 years ago  well  I haven't really enjoyed anything that last week I did a made $75 on that job with the the county basically it was an emergency preparedness exercise they were running for their personnel and the enlisted people to play  the basically the relatives of people who'd been in this fall bombing at the Staple Center and we you know ask question sign up unit on giving information on missing you no relatives and basically I was provided by the county and they said they went to a routine in downtown LA  that's not hard it was just a just a routine we had to follow we had to act like we were actually missing somebody and had to give this ethics of their characteristics height weight excetera  I don't have a best friend  I'm a very bright I'm a perfectionist at my job  I bet about it  I got a business degree and I'm never been a motivated person I went to school I went to  2 state colleges in two junior colleges to need that in so I believe that was probably the most significant contribution that I made to my  anatomiya I guess self-esteem you might say I had something to hang on the wall  yeah I regret you know alienating family members  I would have  basically not been so impetuous and left left jobs think thinking that you know I can always get another one and not you know basically blow-off jobs I could probably work at one of the employers that I used to work for now  Fade Out and locations but I burn Bridges there so that's not possible  thank you  hasta luego

421,female,1,10,doorbell back over here  alright great thank you  and please  are you okay with  yes that's fine  I'm okay how are you  originally I'm from San Francisco  originally I moved here in gosh 1995 then I went to Chicago then to San Francisco and then back to Los Angeles probably about 5 years ago  a lot of moving  never  there just isn't anything there for me anymore  the weather is better in LA but the people in San Francisco are nicer  my husband prefer my ex-husband prefers at here that's why we moved  okay  I have an undergraduate degree in Psychology and after that I went to law school  when I was in college I worked at a law firm and decided that I really wanted to be a lawyer it was really interesting  are you still working in that no now I'm a stay-at-home mom  you find it easy to be a parent know I loved it but it is it is difficult you have to manage a life to make sure that they become a good and successful person  it's easy to kind of do the academics and stuff like that you know I'm good at that the hardest thing I think is to guide them emotionally to help him through things that he's having a hard time with feeling like I don't have all the answers  I'm just seeing them grow and and experience new things and learn about life in the world it's just it's really really cool  what are some ways that your  completely different completely different and I am not a perfect parent but I love my son I take care of him he's the first priority in my life and they weren't like that at all  well my parents are dead I didn't speak to my dad at all before he died I have a sister and a brother that actually I don't know where they are I don't speak to them either  do you consider yourself more shy  probably more shy because I consider myself more reserved  I like to listen to music  like what I have I listen to all sorts of music but my favorite when I'm relaxing is that 80s music cheesy cheesy but true  it depends on who I'm with if I'm with my son I can control my temper if I'm with my ex-husband or other adults yeah I don't  so so  yesterday and it was about my ex-husband dating the woman that he was cheating on when we were married  can you tell me about that  I found out he was cheating on me and I kicked him out and he told me yesterday that he's continuing to date her  yeah  really angry  and just really hurt  I wish that I had talked to my dad before he died I wish that I had settled our differences before he had died  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to  the hardest decision I've ever had to make was actually ending my marriage  because he was cheating on me  that would have to be  well I don't know I mean I don't know if I'd want to erase anything from my memory because it makes me who I am today  but I can't really think of one event that I would want to erase  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep I don't get a good night sleep it's not easy I wake up a lot in the night  I don't know I wish I knew if I knew I could change it I could try to do something about it but I I just don't I don't know  what are you like when you don't  grumpy irritable  grumpy irritable down  mixed with anger  can you tell me about  it's just because of everything that I'm going through with my soon-to-be ex-husband  yeah there's  I just keep it inside  Meador Staffing else to really do except I mean it is what it is so  I have to  deal with it  no  yes  10 years ago after my son was born  9 years ago I felt like I couldn't cope with life  I was so down I couldn't I felt like I couldn't do anything  I need  no  I don't go to therapy I go to medication management but I don't do talk therapy  I have gone to a therapist and no they don't help  can you tell me if  well some just sit and stare at you and don't say anything you know if I wanted to talk to myself I would others give advice that I think is just  it just not not good and not on point  tell me about the last time you felt  it was probably this morning I was playing with my son  just really happy I wasn't thinking about  any of the other crap  in my life I could just forget it so I was feeling really really happy  I think they would describe me completely different from the way I would describe me but I think they would describe me as really sweet they have really sweet confident  outgoing because that's what I try to be two people so I think that's how they would describe me  I wish I wasn't sad I wish I was more confident  yeah there are a lot of things I think  it would be  to not  not give my life over to one particular person which is what I did with my husband  find your ideal weekend  I think I would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like Palm Springs with my son hanging around the pool having fun going out to dinner  one of my two of my friends to really good girlfriend so I think have been really positive influences in my life  can you tell me if  sure life is worse than mine and the but we can always commiserate together  is just really positive me she's always happy always up always look into the bright side so that has helped me a lot  my son  I went over to a friend's house and we had movie night we watch the grown up movie and had dinner and wine and the boys were in another room watching movies and playing video games and it was just a relaxed fun evening  thanks

378,female,0,1,okay I'm pleased  are you okay with this yes  pretty good  I grew up in Boston  about 30 years ago  yep  I'm too often maybe once a year sometimes less  oh I love living in that way I don't ever want to live anywhere else  well I came out here to go to college and I wanted to be far away from my parents and the weather was good and  that's part of it  a very easy well maybe somebody's at the beginning the first few weeks for it's really hard to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody I knew but after a few weeks it was great  broadcast journalism  well it's something I'd wanted to do since I was 12 and everything I did from the time I was twelve until I went to college with sort of in pursuit of that dream  are you still working in that nope  well it's kind of a long story but I got laid off from my first job when I was in my 20s and it just once I'd done that work I realized that's not really what I wanted to do is to cut throat of a business and it just really wasn't suited for me didn't make me happy  yep  dream job my dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries  well the work itself is not very hard I'm very good at what I do. The hard part is finding the right people and making the connections to work with them  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer you travel a lot I used to I don't travel so much right now  what do you enjoy about  I love seeing different places and different things like I love going to places that are not like  where I'm from  I love to hear about one of your trips my favorite trip is I went to Australia from my 30th birthday  cuz I wanted to lose my 30th birthday as I cross the International Date Line  and I went to this really small place up on the West Coast of Australia called sharks Bay where Native dolphins live and swim and is very isolated for the most part and I got to be there for a whole weekend just really just pretty much by myself with all these wild dolphins and they come in they swim with you and it's amazing just a beautiful beautiful spot in the world  more shy  why that's a good question partly the first thing I think of is cuz I've always been that way but maybe that's an excuse I don't know  I just prefer to be quiet and I'd rather be with fewer people than lots of people  so  I watch TV about this probably not the best alternative but it is something I do and I also walk on the beach cuz I live close to the beach so that's one of my favorite things to relax  pretty good  it depends on the situation but most of the time I'm pretty good  I don't think I tend to argue with people I think I just get mad about situations but not at people directly  turn up I feel guilty about anything at the moment  that you wish you would handle differ  not sure I have one at the moment  noise other people's noise makes me really mad I live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and obnoxious and not consider it their neighbors that that just makes me really mad  yeah  well I'm only want the comes to mind off the top of my head is is when I bought my condo it feel like a really hard decision at the time you know I didn't know that I could do it I didn't wasn't sure if I had the money to do it  so thoughtful like a really difficult decision but in hindsight course it turned out to be a great decision but at the time it was really difficult to do that  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep pretty easy I sleep pretty well  for the most part good I'm I'm just really worried about money at the moment so that's my biggest so I can't say that I'm like great but it's cuz I'm worried but you know I'm also confident that things are going to work up  have you ever been diagnosed with p  nope  I don't know I can't remember  I mean I don't feel super happy all the time but I don't feel unhappy either sort of like just a even keel  really enjoy  well I got to go to the my friends work at the motion picture Academy so I get to see all the enough Oscar nominated movies  she was there one night so I really enjoyed catching up with her and seeing her again so that was very pleasant  nice  how your best friend describe you  I think they would say reliable and  well  and considerate and thoughtful  no I really worked hard on that I think there's lots of things maybe I would do differently but there's nothing that really I regret  well I just think that there are things that  like it's not worth wasting the energy to think about things that I regret so I don't have a lot of regrets about things  that's a good question don't worry about the small stuff  and save more money  well as soon as you know the normal things like I'd lose more weight than I would  think be a little more Fearless Maybe  be a little more bold  I don't think I have any of those  it's been your ideal weekend  well I'm I'm self-employed so I work all the time so my ideal weekend is having lots of clients that's something I enjoyed  so that would that would be ideal if this point my weekends if I were really busy  how to make your life  that I've really been able to take care of myself and that you know I've done pretty much everything that I've said that I wanted to do  I've done that and I don't mean I don't have regrets about things there's nothing really that is unfilled undone in my life sure there's plenty of things I still want to do but I feel like I've done what I said I was going to do  yeah that's not so great so it's okay with my parents are deceased and I have a sister and a brother  I feel closer to my brother than my sister but they both live in the east coast and I live in LA and then my sister has two girls so I feel very close to my nieces although we don't talk as much as we used to cook their teenager so  I have other things on their mind  probably my teacher person I've learned my holistic Bodywork from I really like to model my work in my way of being after him the keys are a good role model for me the way he holds his work in the way he lives his life  I'm pretty close we're not you know that's her friends but I do I know that I can call him anytime I need him  what are some things that usually put you in a good mood  you're being with my friends are going out to dinner or  yeah just spending time with my friends  okay  thanks  it works again
307,female ,0,4,"looking at you all right okay so now let's make sure the Xbox Kinect is picking you up with his move around dance  can't wait till this guy pops up is like a little green skeleton  okay when is the temperature let you know and you can just hit the door. So let me know.  thanks for coming in today I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment think of me as a friend I don't judge I can I'm a computer I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you I'll ask a few questions to get it started and please feel  your answers  where are you from originally  Moscow  vitamins for life my family move to the US and then I moved down here eventually for college  how easy was it for you to get used to  long time to leave the money here for about a year since I graduated so there's been a lot of ups and downs but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though that's good  how do you like your living situation. I have two roommates and there's a little bit of drama here and there between the girls but for the most part after a year in a couple months I think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality TV show for a while  how do you know the ones from college and the other one I found on Craigslist  how close are you to that varies depending on whether or not we're mad at each other so I just pretty cuz  right now I kind of distant  tell me more about that event the distance  okay, well we haven't seen each other around hung out in like 2 weeks cuz one of them got into like with car accident and so she's been distant since 10 and kind of locks herself up in her room  and the other one is always working late so we are scheduling has been off and the ones we made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of we're just waiting for someone I guess to make the first move  yeah that sucks it's okay  how are you at controlling your temper  it depends with whom  I'm dealing with I guess I would say it was them people I guess is my family's not very good my boyfriend is not very good but with other people that I might not know so well then I'm able to control little bit more but I'll do a little more passive aggressive rather than my full on anger  Sonic songs  Houston has been a positive influence in your life  she's probably been she's been we've been best friends for High School freshman year of high school when we first mom  give me an example of that  as of what  how do you know that my friend to call we met in French class freshman year of high school we were in the same class and then we kind of surgeon homework together and we had a lot of cloud the same classes together and so you can send Hangouts and then we just became closer and stay really close since then  what are some things you like to do for fun at going out with friends and the bar is going dancing biking hiking staying active then the movies playing at Cedar Restaurant stop tography  was hanging out with friends I guess whatever okay  how close are you to your family and various like I'm really close to them when it comes to things of a like schoolwork those kinds of things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things I don't really discuss that with them  Vegas superficially Club  but I rely on them a lot so what by guess  what are some things that make you really mad  I guess it depends who it is again I guess people who are in considerate and thoughtful flaky ignorant and  yeah and get those kinds of people and then people just and it's a lot of things that people react to different situations can make me angry I guess  when was the last time you argue with someone and what was it about my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money and so so finding that when he doesn't see the orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not very healthy and so I got frustrated with him cuz I'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and that each time he was going to do it when you do it then he doesn't phase consulate breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry people who don't follow through  yeah  do you feel that way often  about other people about myself or angry  whatever comes to your mind  angry I am so glad that now I don't feel angry often  okay  what's your dream job  that is a tough one how about getting paid to leave me now that's kind of what I'm going to figure out right now cuz I quit my full-time job because I hated it as opposed to sitting in an office all day which I thought was extremely boring so now I work in a restaurant job and I'm too old for a second job to support myself my dream job  I don't know what it would be but I know it involves people and I'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment turns band and yet there's something I realized I like to see  the result from all my hard work cuz I majored in sociology and as much as I love that major it's you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing in arguing but with no real solution such as like as a and that's all you have is just being theoretical element that you can't do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or no people amazing artistic I love photography I love cooking baking and particularly so I know something  and that  Mom I guess okay  you travel a lot I used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to 578 different countries I've lived in three or four different countries I haven't traveled a lot lately just because I have no money and jobs kind of tie you down but I would love to have that is my dream job would be a photographer for National Geographic that would be awesome or a food photographer that traveled but anyways you enjoy about traveling  in the new places near faces and experiences I get Restless very easily it says nice of conflict be on the move and see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine I hate the routine and Monday mass of everyday life is so it's nice to  does things.  I want to hear about one of your trips  okay  tennis tank mermaid trips  I have begun talking about I don't know what's funny even though I've been to lots of different country is one of my most memorable memorable trips as one of the trips I took with my family is a three-week road trip with my family this five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon but it was really fun and even though I've traveled so many places I realize that there's like such a beauty and the American landscape and so we were all around this house last in the Grand Canyon to Zion to the Grand Tetons to Yellowstone and it's absolutely amazing to sing about natural beauty is so and it's a grizzly bear black bear the Bison sounds really cool natural wonders also really miss me cuz those things aren't men made as as pretentious as it sounds after while you're kind of gets old but it's like and I guess the same way  white old white man building great buildings in artwork and yeah I see what you mean  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  I want  pretty easy as long as I  get supply I sleep so easy  what are you like when you don't sleep well grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much I just kind of offer in my own world you feel that way often anymore I usually get enough sleep and I've been working out more so it's not too bad that's good  have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately  I haven't just been one negative but I have to do it by circumstances kind of like spend about almost 5 months since I quit my full-time job haven't found anything else boyfriend interested in so  Esmeralda's like what am I doing that I did that kind of thing  can be talked about a good job these days it is higher than market and looks like I'm very picky because I don't want to just sit in a little my own Cuba fault if I quit my job exactly for that reason why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that I quit my other job so it looks like I have to make it worthwhile that I quit my last job to get a better job as a kind of like stuck in this section of like living paycheck-to-paycheck barely making it just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like when did I give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world and spitting and we'll keep a cold I don't know when does that same situation after college so but I guess it's tough cuz a lot of my friends so they went to a pretty good school and you not have a friend his teaching English in Afghanistan  Teach for America and their friends in Hartford at schools like Harvard Matthew not getting her master's that's kind of like  got that comparison and then here I am with you in a little restaurant job so  do you feel down  I do sometimes yes but I'm going to Hawaii next week so right now I'm fine yes but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because I'm just trying to find like what I'm supposed to do you not like what I want to do next and my money situations are just very stressful as a school loan to pay off Insurance rent car loans like ants the groceries but I can't even afford groceries it's just hard to live this way specially after we paid so much money for amazing cause education so frustrating but there's a lot of people the same situation  turn down  have you been diagnosed with depression I don't think so but I mean I think everyone goes through depression here now so I don't know if you can but not like medically diagnose I'm not on meds okay have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD  okay  what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  oh that's to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail cuz I'm one of those people from not going to be the best at something and I'm not going to try except the best or nothing at all go big or go home so but I didn't get them told my high school self that don't try lots of things even if it means I'm not going to be the best at it about 10 years ago made me like 12 so  I used to do a lot of things but I used to ask and it got to continue doing that I used to write a lot when I was younger I used to write miniature like little sorry sorry sorry it's for my parents all the time and I kind of stopped doing those things cuz it's like I'm not good at it so I'm not going to do it I just continue doing those things and tried sneaking out of classes and I'm no different sports soccer growing up I don't know just expand my sophomore rather than likely I'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder cuz like I said I was going to say that one that was like once I'm good I just stay for good and I'll try that go about that that monster Newsom  yeah  what do you do to relax  all right now it's super lame but I watch TV but I used to read of mice to read on my off-time or just listen to music or just take a nap or bake bananas like since I'm on my feet all day and like consol interacting with people I just kind of want to unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and be like I'm done  which one of your most memorable experience  the top question  I'm probably the day I got accepted into Pomona College it was a freshman at Wellesley College courses that woman called back and I hated it from Mike II from like the first week I just knew that I chose the wrong College not like miserable for the entire year and I only apply to one school of the transfer Pomona College by steps at in Clermont and  anime how can I get in and I also because there's like a 4% acceptance rate and if I go to the chances like this is ridiculous I don't think we can get in and I'll let you know the thought of going back to sleep but then I got an email from one of the admissions counselors that I had met when I was visiting Pomona and he's like I talk to you I just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about Pomona hope all is well and I was like why are you telling me the day we find out if we got you next that's it or not unless I got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later I got the email that I was accepted into Pomona and I was like my best day of my life so happy cuz I want ya and I text my mom and my little brother  hair pierce my dad's I was like let's start this whole thing over  how do your best friend describe you  The Voice  fine  maybe Moody you never know what you're going to get sometimes  probably  definitely friendly like a positive person  but sometimes maybe a little bit  aggressive  the most practicing positive things I mean she's my best friend so okay  when is the last time you felt really happy  really happy  oh and I was in Mexico over winter in San Clemente and that was really fun and it just like when sailing and walked on the missions at the beach that was really fun  don't forget time to greet the situation at school  okay I think I've asked everything I need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me  goodbye  I didn't know you were super good thing  set the recording down in a we just have a quick food survey and then I can tell you a little bit more about what"
402,female,1,11,<sync> yes okay atlanta georgia um in two thousand and six never uh i don't like it there <laughter> oh it's completely boring and there's very little to do l_a is preferable i think to most places uh because uh i was engaged to my fiancee and we lived in florida i moved there to be with him and um he loves the water but i love the mountains and i missed hiking and uh i didn't love florida and he wasn't tied to it so we decided we wanted to go somewhere we could both be happy and also have um more opportunities in business and all of the great things that it has to offer very <laughter> very easy there's not much i don't like about l_a i love l_a um i think it feels magical uh so many creative different people of all ages um shapes sizes colors races um the mountains the water uh the city all the things that there are to do all the people there are to meet i just i love everything about l_a no uh i'd rather not talk about it um i didn't go to college i'm still figuring that out um i don't know it may may have something to do with animals i have a dog that i really love and i never had a dog um as an adult i had cats and uh um i think i'm a late bloomer so i'm working on that whole conversation i don't i really don't want a job i want a purposeful way to create wealth not just something to make money in the long run it depends on the situation but in general i consider myself more shy although most people would consider me to be outgoing mm put on classical music <laughter> music classical music if i'm especially <ex> especially stressed and um play with my dog go for a walk i think i'm really good at controlling my temper for the most part um before i came here <laughter> um it was just about um financial stress uh um there's probably a lot of examples i think i'd rather move to another question yeah i'd rather not talk about that either <laughter> i'd rather not talk about that not very easy at all um a lot better recently but um i have a history of chronic insomnia and some health problems so it's challenging um not to feel rested most of the time in the past week i've been feeling a lot better um yes i um the weather has changed spring has sprung it's a little warmer i was having um more trouble with my depression in the winter and um having trouble with tolerating cold and so i wasn't doing  a lot of the things that i normally do and i also was sick with the flu um and in the past week i decided um that i was feeling better enough that i needed to kind of get out of my rut and start um getting more focused around things things that i need to do during the day and walking my dog  every day and um not isolating so much and seeing some of my friends more so i was seeing i've been feeling a lot better like i've been making progress and um that uh in the past week things have taken a more positive turn no yes uh it's been quite some time officially it's probably been i don't know exactly but let's see maybe more than fifteen years ago um i was feeling suicidal no um because i found a better alternative um i have been in therapy off and on since i was eighteen and i've tried a variety of um methods and then uh i started working with a neurolinguistic programmer and um that was really the first person that um helped me uh make permanent changes and i was able to get off my anti depressants as well and even though i've struggled with some bouts of depression it's never been anything extremely severe and um it was one of the best things that ever happened well um i was physically ill with uh chronic fatigue syndrome and i had a client that referred me to this person um because he had cured her of that disease and um that was um he treats multiple issues and so everything is interrelated so um once i had my first conversation with him i knew it was the right step for me i was so happy um i felt like i some um i felt that i found the answer that i'd been looking for that  i hadn't given up hope and uh that um <laughter> i was on cloud nine that i i had been suffering for a a while <wh> a long time and i felt that i finally found the answer to the solution that i was looking for i was like it was the best thing i ever did in my life it was the best decision i ever made i felt extremely hopefuly for the first time in a long time <laughter> um i went to um i went to a music store because uh i had been thinking about um taking up an instrument i used to play the violin as a child and uh i've been wanting to do something that would give me more access to my creative side because i felt it's been extremely repressed and um and so i went to the music store to try out um to see what it would feel like to um to handle an the instrument again and see if i thought that that was something i wanted to pursue it was awesome <laughter> mm yeah i'd rather not talk about that <laughter> um well <laughter> there's probably a lot but um i'm always working on being more optimistic um it's been challenging it takes time but um yeah i wish i could hear my own internal voice better <laughter> yeah i have regrets sure yeah um value myself more so that i would make better relationship decisions uh my fiancee is the most positive person in my life my ultimate supporter uh he's i think very unique not uh not at all selfish and uh probably a little too giving for his own good but um always has my best interests at heart has the highest morals of anyone i know would give somebody the shirt off of his back um is a genius in so many ways and uh um i'm pretty lucky i think that i'm not a quitter that despite some very stressful circumstances over long periods of time i haven't given up on taking risks and um

energy and excitement is so many things to really like about la  seeing a lot of congestion and pollution  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot  hi

would say I get into arguments with people close to me friends and  sometimes I I don't handle them well I am more  reactive  so I wish I'd like to see myself improve on that  no at least not you know not any sort of legal trouble but  I think it's you know it's kind of  not the way that I would like to have handled it  okay  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had  guess the hardest decision was about to  of  how to  proceed with  moving forward on  8  job opportunity  I had to  decide whether  if I would  suffer more emotional Pain by leaving  my family and weather the financial gain and knowledge  of that experience would wood over outweigh the benefit  yes yes I am  well I see small family but  have a mother and a  a sister and a brother  and two younger nieces  the older 3rd ter grown adults good relationship and  things could be better sometimes it's so difficult pain  staking  have relationships at times  there's a some days I'm  I need time for myself and I would rather give the time to  other people rather than the take time for myself which has been my experience and so  that has caused me a me a lot of emotional  pain a little bit of spiritual  anxiety about my future if I continue to do that sort of thing  tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory  there's so many things about you I don't know anything about you  I would say this few but of recent I am  things are going pretty good can really say there's anything as of yet that I would really want to change or or have anything to regret on so I can remember  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  it's been pretty good  and  sense8 it's okay  I'm handling my sleep pretty well  when I don't sleep well sometimes I can be irritable  sometimes it's okay  and I would say if  there's also times where I'm  unhappy  so  I tried it  get as much sleep as I need  yes  I  I believe I was 19  and  I'm glad I did it  yes sort of but yes  no  well  yes I suppose it made me more confident person and more  in tune with  the country that I'm living in and people  to be more noticeable more watchful of where I live  hanging out with some friends on a really nice weekend and on a boat  or I can ask if it's really small boat and  trying to fish in  I felt free or Alive happy  home  uninhibited strong confident mature  half in the

friends and  doing a little bit of socializing  and  maybe get some form of Bone  view some form of artistic expression  there's a maybe you'd like a museum start some art or  maybe something in the local community maybe street art  and  or perhaps something with music or  something something of that nature  I wish perhaps some things that I could change about myself  may be more decisive about

same advice I give myself today  okay  tell me about something you did  really is  wow  I really enjoy spending time with my girlfriend and her two children  that was yesterday  and I'm glad I did that it was a good time for everybody  what are you most proud of in your life  I'm proud of my handsome military and  I'm glad I did that was a good experience  buy thank you  we have a quick post survey for you to fill out in the other computer about your experience.
417,female,0,7,thank you  creative  I'm pleased  are you okay  yes  I'm okay  a Los Angeles  I don't know  kind of dirty but that's to be expected from a big city  my the last class I need to go to Sociology class I'm not really sure where I'm going with school but I'm thinking about sex education  how did you do  I think that is a really important job I feel like  because there's kind of a  Stigmata guess about talking about sex at leads to like a lot of unsafe sex more than planned pregnancies so I feel like it's a very important job for  the world  I don't know  okay  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot  lack of funds  it depends on the people but I'd say that generally more shy of course of people who I know well like we're closer to me I am more outgoing  sometimes when I'm feeling  the best of guy  play with my dogs  I don't know if it's a nice day I'll go for a walk if it's not a nice day then or if it's like cold out or something then maybe watch a show on TV I like or read a book or something  I'd say I'm pretty good at controlling my temper  I can't remember I think the last person I argue with was my boyfriend probably last week but I don't even remember what it was about  you feel guilty about  I don't think I really feel guilty about anything I say that I regret things but I think there's a difference between guilt and regret  like I think guilt is more just like feeling bad but regret is like feeling like you should have made a different decision and I think that can help you in to make better decisions in the future where is guilt you just feel bad for no reason and it's useless  I regret not doing better when I was in high school  I mean not getting better grades I regret  Blake getting involved with certain people in the past but I mean I'm not sure that's about it that I can think of right now  you done anything to avoid  yeah I mean I mean in the past yeah I could have made different decisions I mean obviously some things you know you aren't entirely in your control but I'm not going to feel I'm not going to regret things that I had no power over so  I'm not sure if I would want to erase it from my memory  but  I wish that it didn't happen to me was a time that I was raped  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make  I can't really think of any hard decisions  I can't think of any  okay  tell me about  I'm not sure I can't think of any  I have a pretty good relationship with my family not I wouldn't say that I'm really close with my mother but I mean we get along well and I'm very close to my sister we're basically best friends  I think that my mother has been a positive influence in my life  because she was always able to provide for me and she always she didn't like mistake sometimes but I think that she was always there for me when I needed it and she just did her best to raise me so I think she was a big positive influence  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  it's been easy lately sometimes I have trouble sleeping but  lately I have had no problems  it depends how long I've gone without sleep I can just be anywhere from like groggy to Lake really on edge  and like  extremely tired  I have been feeling pretty good I have like general anxiety kind of all the time but it's not as bad as it has been  in the past  so  I'm feeling mostly pretty good  I think that I've actually been feeling happier lately  I want to say that I'm like really happy all the time I mostly just kind of  like a neutral but I have been feeling more positive lately  I'm actually not sure if I have been diagnosed with PTSD  tell me about  I know that I've been seeing a psychologist for like since I was 16 for depression and I think my first psychologist who I saw for a few years thought that I had PTSD but I'm not sure if she ever made a diagnosis  did you think you had a problem before you found out  I'm not sure  I don't know  yes  it's helpful to talk someone and have them kind of  guide you in talking about something so that you can figure things this figure out your feelings about things sort of I guess for yourself or like why it helps to talk with somebody because you can figure out why you're feeling a certain way about something I mean I think sometimes you can do that on your own but talking to somebody helps I think  not sure  I'm not sure  I'm not sure  I think I would spend it mostly at home  but it would be sunny out and I would go outside a little bit and and play with my dogs and  I probably have my boyfriend over  I eat food that I like like only through that I like like my favorite foods watch  movie or TV show that I like just  kind of have like a relaxing time but that's nice  I would tell myself to  to to do better in school because throat High School is kind of an underachiever and I ended up going to Community College like on and off because I would like to have lose interest and then not do well or as well as I could have so I would tell myself to do as well as I could in school because I feel like I am capable of a lot more than I do and I think I could easily have gone missing a scholarship if I have done well in high school so I just tell myself to do good in school and probably wore myself about one or two people that turned out to be not worth my time  I think I am proud of myself for not being bitter and for wanting to live kind of bitter and yes but I guess I'm proud of myself for not being selfish and wanting to make the world a better place like cuz a lot of bad things have happened to me and I tried to instead instead of dwell on them I try to or I want to be able to make things better for other people and as much as I want to help I guess Empower people to make their lives better
380,male,0,10,that I am  alright thank you so much Rachel  hi I'm Ali thanks for coming in today  created to talk to people in his face  I'm not a  are you okay with  sure  I'm fine I'm doing all right  yeah  from Maryland  yeah the Maryland Washington DC area  I like 5 weeks ago  Maryland  it's a lot it's a lot less  it's at. It's not as nice this time of year it's more  it's it's good it's nice it's always a lot better though it's a lot it's a lot more people a lot more going on  I'm still I guess I'm still getting used to it so  it's  it's not like  yeah I'm still getting used to it it's coming slowly but but surely  I live in Culver City  I do I have one  it's okay it's I live in a really nasty house it's me it's cheap it's cheap cuz I'm living in a friend's place  and  but but if he's letting me stay there for half price but the at the actual like Place itself is pretty horrible living conditions but I'm moving inside  I can't see your shoes actually  but no I I travel meet us at met by probably traveled more than most people in the US like considering that most people don't travel in the US but I wouldn't I wouldn't call myself a world Traveler  I enjoy the chance to get to like see other walks of life and and and kind of like meditate on the  the specificity of my own you know the the the given the parameters that I grew up under like how different everyone else is like how how every life is totally I mean even just within the US like seeing how someone in California grows up is so different from how someone in Maryland grows up and then to think about someone in like Thailand or something growing up it's pretty pretty amazing  okay  put me on the spot here Ali  let's say  well I  it's been awhile since I've been on a trip I guess one of the last trips I did was to  I made a lot like two years ago I went on a road trip across the u.s. and that was that was pretty amazing saw but I guess the best put the best two places on the drive from Maryland to LA this is before I actually moved out here but I visited New Orleans and New Orleans was just this whole like even though it's part of the us it's like a totally it's totally different than anywhere else it's so unique the culture they are so unique and and the blend of like Caribbean in French and all these other influences into like the American South is so so yeah it's just it's it's unreal  tough question  what  can you come back to that question are you capable of that  come back to it  yeah so just that  dumb  you know that's actually a question I've been asking myself I knew I know my entire life I've had like phases of Interest so when I was like very very very young I was really into like the first phase that I remember was keys and then tools like a girl around collecting keys and then I go around collecting tools like just every sort why the toolbox my parents have told me that I had faced before that with his balls like various balls and then I was really into like insects collecting insects and reptiles and instead like animals and then the dinosaur phase and at a certain point I got really into like rat like music like the first rap and then guitar and then acting and then it's some point in their I I I remember telling someone that right now I'm interested in playwriting and and poetry but eventually I was going to be interested in in  film think I could kind of see the trajectory coming but I don't remember what led me to that conclusion I think I just always I would love to sheltered life as far as movies are concerned I didn't my parents didn't let me see an R-rated movie until I was like in high school of us like and and I never signed a lease on R-rated movie I was also very squeamish like I remember when I was fairly young maybe like 6 I saw Star Wars the first seen a Dark Star Wars Darth Vader cracked like brakes a guy's neck at just a little scene bear at the very very beginning and that like freaked me out and I had to leave the room so  I'm not really sure  yeah it's it's it's I'm not exactly sure how I got into film but I've always been fascinated by like how people interact in what like you know acting and stuff something movies in general  I am yes  to be a filmmaker to be able to direct and put together and like I cuz I don't use that word so much cuz I think I think of it more as like I want the opportunity to put together and make movies or to make movies is probably the best way to do it to say it cuz I want you and I want involvement in all the all the processes but  I guess the best Parable for that would be a director directing  well it's a lot better when I'm not living with them my  I guess  it's funny you should ask Ellie thinking about it a lot lately I think I'm close in my entire family on closest with my dad I get along with my brother and sister you know like but I don't  went away like my brothers in a foreign country right now so I don't have the opportunity to talk with him but like I spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else cuz I feel like he's the most like  of all my family he's the one who most except me in like things positively about me I have like a  a complicated relationship with my parents I met on my family and general  you can put yourself more shy  well on the Myers-Briggs personality test I'm I'm an extrovert but like since moving but I'm not like  I'm not I probably we consider myself on the scheme of extraversion are on the scale of extraversion sorry I would consider myself extremely introverted  I just I see other extroverts in just a matter who they're around there a little like strike up conversations in a fairly shy person them sort of like or inhibited person maybe  so I like to like  until  yeah but I'm working on it I'm working on it  what I'm feeling  I turn on the fish tank screensaver  hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got  what are you doing  well in the past I would smoke weed but I quit smoking weed so now I do not have a glass of wine and maybe watch a movie I don't have or maybe go like depending if it's like an ant if it's if it's a worn-out sort of stress like I like then I that's what I do but if it's more like anxious type stress I might go on an intense walk don't really exercise that much but I like in a competitive Sports and hiking  pretty good  well I always like arguing  I wouldn't call arguing this to losing my temper  I enjoy a vicious debate but I don't  as long as my like cuz I won't like revert to personal you know attacks in my in my arguments I try to keep it on subject and try to explain myself as best I can which can get frustrating cuz I'm not like the best articulator of what I think one of my weekly points I would say  but I but the last time I had a heated debate I think that was not the question  when is the last time that happened what happened I forgot I forgot to mention that that I had a heated debate  last time I had a heated debate  was had a heated debate about the movie Boogie Nights I didn't lose my temper exactly but I like very extremely passionate about about that I don't think it's like that good of a movie but the two people who I was I was arguing with her saying that it was like one of the like best best movies why did they think it was the best movies  they think that like there's something there's some sort of as I understand it they have  they have a certain they think that the  take all of the stories with in Boogie Nights they have their own like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole lake complexity of character within the movie and  but somehow like  what were they saying they were saying like the movie  it's like it's like the end of an era which makes it look kind of like casino and there's this attention to detail of of the in the different character like how they how they interact in the plot kind of like  yeah I guess I think the heated debate became about like that so from there and like personally it's not like a bad mood or anything but it's the I just don't think Dirk Diggler is like that like me meaning full of a character like I like it the way I come out I came out of the movie cuz I had seen it before many years ago night at my opinion of it is basically the same even though like I remember it like in watching it again I was able to re-evaluate it there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing I like articulable about that sleeps has a good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool that you know it's cool it's but but it's meat for me it was like meaningless and then two and then they were that let us to discuss the movie that I recently that I really did like his Django Unchained and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie and then there was the Sixth Street I get the heated part of the conversation came about like so in the mood  Django Unchained you have Django and jango's like it kind of has a two dimensional character but I don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big the big purpose of the movie is and you have dr. King Schultz who's this who's this like his mentor character and the person I was arguing with was saying that he was intelligent and so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would have risked his life to save Django or like would have gone into this like second act where they go and they go to the plantation to deceive Django's wife excetera and and the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not  sacrificed himself for someone else which straight which strikes me as so like  like who like she's her bit her basic argument was that like altruism doesn't it cuz it was too. I even ran type of argument altruism doesn't exist the only the only thing you can do is sit like the only thing people do is serve them self so it's not quite Iron Man but it's like the only thing that people like old people are out to serve himself which I'm not arguing that like every decision has like a mix of altruism in and something like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor in an in like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate  hurt like if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so let it to an extremely passionate debate and somewhat like yeah it is said that  so so yeah that that I guess that's the I don't think I necessarily like lost my temper I think I'm losing my temper is being more  like I just I would  revert to ad hominem like attacks but I didn't like that's not maybe I was like maybe I was criticizing her worldview but I wasn't like well you're an idiot you know like it wasn't it didn't it didn't turn into abuse of any sort yeah I'm glad you understand  an event or I don't know if I necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory I would say an issue that I have is not being able to remember in as much detail as I would like to remember feelings and moments not stories like my life doesn't always think together until like a coherent story it's like this moment in that moment in this moment in that moment yeah  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make  the hardest decision I've ever had to make  ouchies  could it just be one of the hardest decisions  choosing between two things that it's like  I guess I'm having a hard time recalling a moment where I like had to choose between  two options like no there's no like Sophie's Choice type moment in my life  but I but I do think that the decision cuz I lived in New York for a while I went to school in New York and the decision to leave New York after having lived there for five years was it was very very difficult  and but I had to do it for money reasons and because all of my all my core group of friends were either likely were Muslim we're leaving and going other places in the world and then the one other person or as close to it was living with someone who I did not get along with it all so it's like the situation where I didn't lose either going to live with people who I wasn't his clothes with or Craigslist or or move home and I think it was a tough decision to to leave that the only way I could do it I had to justify it by saying that I would be moving back to New York with in like a month or two which wasn't which didn't end up happening but that was the only way that I could leave New York  you was how hard was that or how hard is how hard was that  it was it was just a very like isolating ice is also like I'd felt like previously to that time I'd fallen in love with one of my closest another one of my close very close friends and  that had kind of gone extremely  badly and so I wasn't on speaking terms with her and I couldn't like that whole everyone on my list of friends who was like closer to her her it was quite like her me type thing but that that was the way that I kind of  saw it at the time so I didn't like you know just being socially isolated  yeah  how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep was recently it's been awful  I like to eat so the last last night I slept for like 10 and a half hours which seems to be the length of time that I have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams but previous to that night  so last not last night but the night before last and the night before that I got four hours in 2 hours of sleep cuz I was working on sat and I would get back and either and I just like couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason it's  too much Roundup energy or something I don't know  tired very  not immediately I just initially upon waking up like I really enjoy being up in the early morning  and I also stopped drinking caffeine like I've had like a little bit of coffee the last two days but before the last two days I hadn't had any coffee in like three and a half weeks so  I guess with with caffeine in my system I'm ready to I'm ready to go without caffeine it's I'm just I'm just quieter I guess  more introverted  since Lake lately is in Latin  changing my thoughts yeah I mean I guess when having just moved here and there is a. Of time like at the beginning where the  the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people. They moved here cuz I have a group of friends here or couple of friends I don't have like a large number friends and the the push 2  to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure is pretty overwhelming at first and I think that I'm slowly like  coming to terms with that  and moving in a moving past it at but not like it's still it's still there the pressures there but I'm just you know  you know you know you know  no I just  nope  the last time I felt really happy  might have to reach back  I think the last time I felt really happy  was during the writing process of salt last year I shot a movie co-wrote co-directed co-produced  and that was kind of like that it still consumes my life but I think that during the  writing stages of that movie in which we would like get up eat breakfast bunker down work really hard put stuff up on the thing just like pure creative  energy between me and the person riding it in  and there is like probably like a good day that I remember where it's just I remember going to bed and I was just so thrilled to be working on when I was working on and and and working with the person I was working with and like  just like  I felt like it yeah I guess that was the the last time that was that was like more than a year ago though but I guess it's hard it's hard to think that I haven't been really truly happy since then but when you're making a movie like you don't you can't allow yourself to be happy especially if you're doing it basically by yourself with with like kind of like you can't too much else to do  I would say that I'm very  except like accepting of other people and always very empathic  and  open like  excited about new ideas and open to new ideas and  yeah  I guess I wish I was last  less ruled by fear more more Fearless in my you know  everyday in our actions and in my like  you know  zest for for living  yeah I  I got other things I would change about myself I would I would  I don't know  really badly about myself  I Need A Renewed numerous instances in my childhood in which my like like every single time there was an issue at school or some sort of  some sort of  conflict with a teacher or anything my parents were always  always on the other side of the Court you know like never it was I noticed  or noticed as I got older that other people other parents were like at their kid was in trouble like there's something wrong with with like their kid was perfect there something wrong with other people but my parents were it was always the opposite in particular my mom sorry it said that there are a couple of instances in which  I was like blamed her like you know  it was my was my fault when  when what I was doing it like  Yeah Yeahs think things things that I couldn't like  no yeah I don't know  yeah  10 years ago  stay steak unit like I I think that there is  I have a tendency to  like I'd love to love the fact that I have a tendency to get really caught up in ID in an idea in like devote myself entirely to it but sometimes  ideas are too easily decided to say like do as much as possible like don't don't decide that you  are only going to do one thing try to like I guess I would have taken up like some taking piano learn learn to read music would be a big thing for me learn to play the drums would have been drums more than reading music I would say I'd love to learn how to play the drums and maybe done more like acting classes  as far as like cuz I was always really into directing so he's directing actors and stuff but I didn't it's only now that I I don't know I guess  stay  Don't Stay Stay Stay yeah I don't know that's a tough tough tough question la  that's it  sure  goodbye  but  all right  experience with Ellie
437,male,0,0,okay  oh okay  yes  I'm doing pretty good  I was born in Los Angeles  I like the diversity of the city all the attractions and things that you can see food restaurant  it's like that  traffic freeways crime  yes I do  seeing new places or going back and seeing same places and just enjoying the Lacs and getting away from LA  Wellwood said last trip by made with up to the central coast up in Cambria and Pismo Beach area and Solvang standing  yeah  probably a when I got to study abroad in Madrid Spain when I was a student at UCLA  sometimes a child yeah I was I participated in the education abroad program at UCLA where you go live in another country to learn language when you live before year after University study at the University and that it was just a memorable year and experience that I would never forget  thanks  probably more shy but the that sometimes I could be outgoing  I'm more shy in terms of being alive. It takes me it takes time for me to get to know people I mean I'm not a real party person I don't like to go to parties and meet people and things like that but if I'm among friends and think like that but I can be for the outgoing  with people I know  the drink wine  yeah I drink wine maybe listen to some nice music  pretty good I can I'm pretty good at controlling my emotions  oh gosh I wouldn't say it was a real argument it was more like a discussion maybe about  finances Maybe  money  I was just a little irritated but the not really not really strong emotional  oh  wow guys I can't think of anything at the moment so I'll look for the skip that one  maybe  eating eating more junk food than I admit to  or  the hardest decision I ever have to make  Maybe  buying a home buying a home or remodeling the home  spending money for  it was a I felt it was time to move on with my life and to buy a place for myself so I could be self-sufficient and independent  yes very happy  and then I could erase from my mouth when I when I was when I was student teaching for a year trying to get my teaching credential undiscovered I never enjoyed it I want a race that whole year 1983  it just brought back horrible horrible memories of what I went through when I was student teaching in the discovered that teaching K-12 with no not for me  I stood my major was Spanish and linguistics  what made you decide  I was very good on languages and I thought them I enjoyed taking them and I was just having a good time taking foreign language and I was getting good grades so I thought maybe this is what I should go into foreign languages  I was teaching I was in the Delta teacher teaching English as a second language for 30 years and I just recently decided to retire myself  I have a pretty good relationship with my family with my mother and my sisters and my father passed away in 2008 and my relationship with my father wasn't as good as with my other family members  fucked up on the phone the whole time we have pretty good relation with the with my family now  pretty easy I don't have any problems  if I don't sleep well I'm I may be moving around in the bed and messing up the sheets but that doesn't happen too often  pretty good I think I've been feeling pretty good no major health problems or anyting  no  no  no  last time I was really happy  I probably when spring break came around and with a vacation time and it was time to go on our trip  yeah it was a it was a week trip up to Central Coast to Cambria and Pismo Beach and Santa Ynez was just the nice getaway relaxing on the hotel lawn and garden drinking wine and enjoying different sites and eating good food and then buying were going to replenish our dwindling Supply at home  I think she would describe me as a kind and sweet and motivated and nice person  oh sometimes I wouldn't mind being a little more outgoing I guess I tend to be more reserved so I wouldn't mind being more outgoing towards strangers and things with  really badly about myself probably when I betrayed a confidence with some friends of mine when I take them when I tape them singing Christmas carols and I I played it to some other people and they found out and they really laid a guilt trip on me for doing that  but it all got resolved at the end we all we became we were all hot it was just a bad misunderstanding on my part but it worked out okay  probably having done what I did bikes playing at the other people  what advice would I give myself 10 or 20 years ago and don't give up just keep keep pursuing what you want never never give up with CU does a hint of a disappointment if nothing if it doesn't work out  I'm a I'm a good listener I'm I'm a motivated person I'm hardworking I'm conscientious I'm caring assembly a pretty happy type person  something recently when I really enjoyed  going to the going to the Festival of books at USC this weekend  yeah that Festival of books is it's a festival where they have all these off authors and they have them food demonstrations seminars and all kinds of books available to look at and there is a lot of food and then a lot of authors signing books and things it's a great event for her to get out and end with nice weather to so it's nice to be out there I really enjoyed that  thanks  I'm most proud of  most proud of probably being successful in my work and my life and my marriage and  I just basically being happy with myself  well you're welcome  bye  but it  oh okay I wasn't sure if I was supposed to bring it over haha
323,female,0,1,sure  good chicago  it's cold in chicago  hmm oh i think in ninety nineteen eighty nine actually  oh very simple very easy  oh weather of course and i'm so easily located to san diego palm springs las vegas san francisco and things i like to do smog of course is bad  crime rate's higher than it should be um  and financial economic problems here  every year thanksgiving  very very much so we're a very big family  yes i do very much in fact i love flying on airplanes i love visiting new places i even like visiting different airports everyone's different  ooh let's see  i started off in pre-med haha i ended up in uh physics yes i am i teach <tea> i teach physics  and math and higher level math  well i enjoy working with kids  i enjoy teaching my mother was a teacher uh my dad was a truant officer and uh i've enjoyed it keeps you young  my dream job  my dream job would be to be a judge  yes in in the uh  youth court that would be fantastic but i should've thought of that sooner than now so i'm not gonna be able to do that  no <laughter> not at all  um i enjoy people being around people i'm very talkative at times uh  i like to do a lot of things and i'm very social when i do them  uh believe it or not i play bridge i play chess and i watch a good old old movie  ooh bad drivers  uh bad laws  politics often  when i'm annoyed  you know i really don't get annoyed that much i just let it go  it's not worth the pain and problems they could cause if i can't straighten out a problem let it go   go somewhere else  ooh always my bridge partner but that's different uh as far as anything else i don't really argue with people i i don't argue i don't like confrontation my parents of course very very much so um i had great parents  uh  my mother uh my parents met at tuskegee which is a black college and they always want me to go to a black college but of course i didn't wanna do that <laughter> uh i went to illinois so they're a very positive role model for me there's certain things that i don't do today because of them i don't drink i don't curse i don't look down on people who do but i don't have as much respect for people who do a lot of either one of those things um  i love to drive i love to travel and my dad used to always take us some place every weekend he was off we'd go somewhere 'cause we were in chicago indiana michigan some place in the area we'd go up to michigan and pick fruit or we got all our dogs from uh puppy farms in indiana that kinda thing uh i had an uncle who lived in uh wisconsin who was a dairy farmer so my dad used to love to drive and i love to drive also  mm that's a hard one  i've had a lot of great experiences uh i think the best one was uh we went for my anniversary we went to europe we went to paris and uh  we rode the orient express we went from we didn't go all the way to istanbul we went from london to venice and then flew back to paris uh    that was probably the best experience i've ever had in my life i i've never really cared for europe because there's so much here in the united stated to do and so much in america and i had been to alaska and hawaii but we said we'd do something different and we'd always wanted to go on the orient express and we did that expensive but phenomenal trip gotta do it once it's a once trip not once in a lifetime just once not traveling more sooner we did a lot when the kids were younger  but um there are a lot of things we should've probably done we didn't do i wish i had gone to chicago <chica> we would always go to chicago on thanksgiving but i think we should've gone more than just on thanksgiving my parents come here at around christmas time but i think we should've uh done a lot more when it comes to that  yes that's that's that's why it's a regret because it could've been avoided there's things we could've done and we were spending our time working and more concerned about getting ahead than actually family and what's closest to us     i think that people <peop> most people oh yes very definitely  ooh  that's a good question ten or twenty years ago  i would've said um don't take things too seriously but don't be too relaxed over 'em either sometimes you can uh take things for granted never take anything for granted  nothing's promised  oh heaven forbid  <laughter> no i have not <laughter> no no  no  very very easy i really have no problem with that once in awhile if i uh am anxious about something or have things coming up due or projects due then i get kind of uh anxious a little bit  i don't like to be late uh i don't like to make mistakes so therefore i i do have some anxiety issues which will cause me to stay up all night to get things done just to make sure that i have everything right  tired  i don't get irritable i think i just uh lethargic maybe a little <litt> just a just a little bit  very good i was up late last night so i'm kinda tired now but i i usually have no problems sleeping  uh and i get a good night's sleep  mhm no i have not  um no not at all i just came back off a christmas break <laughter> so i'm should be very relaxed now ooh i have great kids  i have a son at u_s_c and i have a son at u_c_l_a  and my daughter just got married  so i'm i'm proud of my i'm really proud of my kids  they're they're going to have a good life  oh yes um i enjoyed it i still enjoy it  being a parent is forever <laughter> so  uh <sigh> let's see  taking care of someone else and getting started off to have a good life   i think that that's rewarding making sure everything is covered  that needs to be covered with you kids whether it's their eating their sleeping their clothes they dress make sure they're content make sure they have no problems at school or home or uh that that they're safe physically mentally spiritually everything hmm my best friend would say she has not changed since high school <laughter> uh level-headed but uh great sense of humor relaxed i don't take things too seriously ooh i love the holidays i love christmas i love everything about it i love preparing the house for it i love baking cooking especially baking i love experimenting with new recipes and so the last couple of weeks because the holiday season was just here i felt fantastic everything is is quiet i'm not at work i'm not stressed out in any way at all i have no projects due that i have to think about anyway  so uh christmas time holiday time  really enjoyed recently well christmas of course we went to las vegas um the twenty seventh of december that was fantastic <fantas> we only stayed for

303,female,0,0,wow okay  when you're finished when she's done  okay  thank you  how are you doing today okay how about yourself  here in California  all well that is big and bras a lot to do a lot of  I'm job opportunities than other states pretty much that is big and it's a lot you can do here  traffic Maybe  the violence right the bad news even though you don't even want to know what's going on in your environment but you still have to watch it so you can you know look out to see what's going on on a daily basis  sociology I have a  2 year degree in Liberal Arts but my major was sociology  no I'm actually MTA bus operator  what's your  well since Metro is study growing my dream job is to move up in the company and I'm about to actually start some classes for supervisor free next week so cuz they look to promote within the company so that's a good thing is a lot of opportunities at Metro where you can take classes in their pay for your tuition and things of that nature  thanks  well it's not actually hard as right now is easy if you take advantage of it right now cuz they look to promote within so you know since I'm already working there that's a good thing so is good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible  what do you mean I'm sorry  okay  free take a long walk hot bath  meditate just close my eyes sometimes  okay  I'm pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you got to remain calm and still remain professional at the same time  well I look at it like it it goes with a Ami comes with experience you know you do something on a continuous basis usually you somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so I I look at it like that so I've been driving for years and dealing with the public so it's just how you handle circumstances how you treat people like you want to be treated  I'm pretty good at it now maybe when I were younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and I'm still learning today  I will say my family you know my kids so you know even though you don't have been having a lot of deaths around me but that's just that's part of the  life experience you know you born here but you got to leave here one day but  my kids will keep me you don't saying and you know I love them in my family  thank you  no  set good examples you know because you're the first teacher you know and you want to set a positive good example for your kids and I think that's a good thing and it starts at home  well  by you being the first teacher your kids you're that you're you're the one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they looking and learn everyday you know brother is that homeschool you know kids have a tendency to do things with a c you know what I mean so you try to keep it positive teaching good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature  I have a 4 1/2 year old son I have a seven-year-old daughter and I also have a 23 year old  yeah I'm about to be well my daughter's pregnant with the boy she has three little girls go have three grand kids and one on the way which is the boy this time  yeah thank you  the hardest thing is we're right now I'm a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and  they can be expensive at times you know and depends on the person's situation you know whether they have helped or job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you are trying to keep a job you know keep food in the house you know just maintaining support my kids the best way I can  with my kids or Just.  what's memorable for me is that I'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kind of like yeah it's kind of even though I'm the baby of 10 kids you know and I always kept in the back of my mind even though everybody will pretty much my whole family have decent job but I'm the one with the degree so I kind of like gave myself a pat on the back like you know you know I just that's the only thing I remember and graduating you know and my family is there to support me  thank you  happy that I accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just having a high school diploma and I had I was working on my bachelors degree but I ended up in a bad car accident I never went back I got distracted and you know I was working at the same time but I was just like more so I needed income then then I'm schooling at that time because I was a young parent you know cuz I have my daughter at 17 so I was like I made it the money to support her but I never went back but I feel like it's never too late so I feel like I take some classes now that I'm with Metro to help me move up the ladder so that's why I'm starting my class next week  thank you  well device I would have gave myself  then I probably would have been a young mother at a young age and that  I probably wouldn't  stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not I would have remained in school I probably would have had kids early you know  whether I probably would have stayed in school and probably have a part-time job or something just I just feel like education is an excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learn different things keep your mind open to learning new ideas every day so I think that's a plus you know and anybody shoes that's the better they sells you know through education maybe two maybe promote within your company or whatever the case maybe they help better your career  I'm quite sure you learn from your mistakes you know you but the same time you don't continue to make the same ones I feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know like myself even though I'm going to school late but still I'm going you know I want to better myself career-wise so  yes  my oldest daughter  we had an argument because  the life she's living right now in the things that she's going through and I had told her that she just need to make some changes to better her situation and I'll we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't want to hear it you know here's the stuff that you're saying even though  is true or  or they just you know quote they just don't want to hear it you know they may be going through something they don't want to hear but we got into argument about it but  lettuce happened you know  I just told her my I'm sorry  very close very close is that the situation my daughter's name right now she just needs to make some changes to better her her life  and I've been  she kind of like stubborn in their own way you know I was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom is not going to tell you nothing wrong and I've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's kind of like I was talking to a wall because she did the opposite and now she's she regretting it you know cuz she's like my mom told me that I'm doing the opposite so I guess you got a bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kind of like I didn't told you I left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change  how hot is it  it's very frustrating because it's like I'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me and I'm like it seems like it's taking forever for the change but it's left up to the individual when they're ready you know what I mean one supposed to get tired of something they make a change it may not be when you wanted to have him but  the ball is in her Court you know  only can do so much  oh wow  Oh my days  since I have two little ones my kind of like trying to go to bed at 8 because you know they got to go to school and I think it's important have a good night's rest because it kind of like  it it kind of like I guess you're ready for the next day or you know how you going to feel if you rested what type of person going to be that day you know cuz everybody have their days you know rather than good or bad but that's just part of life and I feel like if you had a good night good good night rest hopefully you have a good day you know  pretty much you know I need my rest because I'm out there driving a bus and dealing with all these people and you know the job is stuff is very stressful so I feel like if I'm rested and it helped me  what am I like irritated tired lazy  you know  feel like I want to lay down probably go to sleep  never thought about that you know  cuz like I said you know everybody had a moment to do  I thought about that  no  no  okay  how your best friend describe you I don't really have a best friend but person that I deal with it I used to work with she'll probably tell you that I'm very outgoing a go-getter Dependable responsible  I'm a people person  I get along with others you know I'm kind of like  I live in a good Mark  whether I know you are not if you was to you know like like you and I now you know I I I  you probably sell she seems like a nice young lady or whatever you know something like that  thank you  well  I try to stay happy I rather be happy than sad my kids keep me going you know what I mean  especially when I go to pick him up from school or just up to me  thank you  you're more than welcome you have a good day  goodbye  you're welcome  okay  that is so interesting
367,male,1,19,are there any parameters aren't I mean is should I just talk naturally or just went wherever I'm comfortable okay I get there  one last thing  let you know when she's done I'm going to hand you the  okay  and please  are you okay with this  yes  how are you doing  I'm okay I'm a little  pensive I guess a little down but more or less okay  I was born in Annapolis Maryland on the East Coast  originally I moved because I went to film school and but then I decided to come move back to Washington DC to do some work and now I'm back here again  it's very different being from the East Coast it just has a different feel to it but living  La is very as a very different kind of attitude I guess and so it's a little difficult but I but I've gotten more used to it since I've been here  not at all when I left things got things are sort of I lost my job out there and so I had to move out here kind of quick to to be with  some people who are going to help me out and I'm just I don't know if it's strange just the right word but I'm kind of not really speaking to my family are old friends that off  it's not easy it's  it's kind of  I miss I miss a lot of people I miss my old life before I lost my job I miss some friends I miss a lot of the relationships that I had out there so it's difficult I mean it weighs on my mind a lot I feel like I failed and now I'm here and I can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard  you consider yourself more shy or outgoing  depends on the situation I think I'm out going when I'm comfortable and then I'm extremely outgoing but when I'm in a situation I'm not comfortable with this I tend to be a lot more shy so that doesn't really answer your question but  I have certain  I do I do a lot of writing I have certain music that I listen to as I'm writing and when I can when I can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world the music and the the thoughts just kind of happening really it can it soothed me it's like it's when I feel most relaxed I guess  when is the last time that happened  a few weeks ago I guess I was I've been working on a on a on a book on a novel and when I was really what I was really getting into writing it and  it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good I felt like I was accomplishing something and I was felt really relaxed  what was it about  it was about  guy who's searching for something it's  it's it's his last day on Earth and so he's going to find a person that he that he met and just  I was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes he has on Earth with her just because  certified it's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing  what made you decide to do that  well I've always I've always been a writer part of the reason I came to La was because of screenwriting so I wrote some screenplays and you know had a little bit of success with that out here and but since since that I kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and I've started to write more short stories and and longer just creative writing so I've been meaning to write a novel by just waiting for the idea that to really hit me  how hard is that  it's not easy the the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle I find it difficult I have a real love hate relationship with writing when I when I love it I just absolutely love it but sometimes I hate it because it's so difficult but it's worth it for the times when it when it's good  how are you at controlling your temper  good I don't I don't really have a temper it's not I mean most of my anger that I have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people if something is really really stressful if I'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation I can lose it but I've put probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life I mean generally I pretty much try to it when I'm upset I get upset with myself not with other people  when was the last time you argue with someone  last night I guess I got in an argument about whether or not  cleaning vegetables was necessary because of I forget but it well know it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because I'd already started cutting the vegetables and I thought that would be okay so it turned into this big argument and we did Google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and I I ended up being wrong on that one but it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow-up argument but it was a definite argument  okay  what's something you feel guilty about  lot so much  I was in a relationship that I really really better really wanted to work and  I ended up and it was partly due to I hadn't I was on that I wasn't on the right medication and so I was going like everything that sort of spiraled out of control and I feel really guilty about the way that that ended I mean I wasn't I wasn't mean but I was but I was getting more and more messed up and I couldn't stop it and it ended and so I feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not  and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again so  that was pretty that was pretty tough  you've done anything to avoid it  what some of it was was that  I wasn't medicated properly I mean now I've been to a doctor and I'm on medication that's  completely kind of I mean I still get I still get upset and I still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not I don't completely lose it for days at a time so I mean I know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if I had if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then I would have then it would have probably been different if I was who I am now then I would have I would I would be  I would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but I mean I could have  I don't know I don't know if I could have done anything different  things being how they were  I mean it's  it's possible I mean obviously  yeah because I mean that's what I do I I  take little I mean I take little things and I just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy I dwell on stuff and it's like any little detail that comes up I suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day I mean I still I still get I still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed and I feel ashamed about stuff that I did in high school which was years and years ago I which I shouldn't even be thinking about anymore cuz it's so in the past but I still get that feeling like I'm right back there  that sounds really hard  well it's not easy I've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it I mean I dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to slow my mind down that way but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better  well like I said I do a lot of you know if I'm if I'm writing or if I'm doing anything like I kind of have to almost  you doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely if I'm watching TV I have to be playing a game on my phone if I'm using the computer I have to be you know watching a TV show or a movie on you know on it in another window so that I can just keep my mind occupied during all that  I just need I mean I I wish that I could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but I just I can't yet  I need triggered by something  they're triggered by everything pretty much anything that I said I see if I if I if I hear somebody with a Dutch last name if I if I hear somebody talk about Wisconsin if I hear you know she will talk about  anyting you know I can reach back and connect to  to this it's really it's really  I don't know that's the thing I mean I don't ever get a break  from it  now  how easy is it for  I'm a very light sleeper so I'm awake and asleep and awake and is I have no problem going back to sleep but I generally you know don't  I don't know I'd never really needed much sleep so it's just only recently that I've really started to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep like I would I would usually stay up until 2 or 3 in the morning so that I could just be so exhausted that I would just calling out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work but now it's it's it's like if I do that I can't I still don't get enough sleep I don't clock out I still just sleep very lightly you know I get up I toss and turn all night you know and now  it's just it's  yeah I don't sleep too great right now  pretty I mean I don't know it's hard to it's hard to know I usually just kind of power through it and just I'm at I'm like how I am now I just I just feel bad  okay  how long ago were you diagnosed  I think  334 years ago  it was when I  I had been given taking stuff for anxiety for 4  years before that but then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you actually got this situation and we need to get you the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so  so yeah that was that was kind of a turning point but unfortunately it happened after everything went bad so  at the moment I don't know I don't really think I thought about it too much then but looking back on it I feel  it really makes me angry it really makes me you know given where I am right now it makes me really angry that I'm  that I had that I I lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain because of things that I couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me I mean I was paying I was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing it you know it wasn't  it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know I managed to find somebody who did work and I just yeah so I'm I'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now  there really wasn't any choice I had to I was I was a mess I was it was either  I was I was self-medicating it was affecting my work I mean it was everything was just there was a point where I really realized that I mean I just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and and all this stuff you know they just decided that I was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off  but it was at least that and not  firing me but but but yeah but so I got help but it was  but it wasn't soon enough  not not as much as I should  I go to a couple of meetings I go to I go to AA so that I can you know keep control of that aspect to 2 and there's a there's a therapy aspect that unfortunately you know being unemployed my unemployment ran out you know I'm time you know what I'm getting my medication from the city of La so you know I'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody so I have a psychiatrist that I go see but it's really  very I've only seen her three times in the past year so basically to keep my medication coming  then there's you  right  changes have you noticed  well like I said I mean  this the top I mean let's just take the AAA for example because that's probably the close closest for that I'm seeing with therapy right now just saying stuff out loud is just like getting getting the stuff out trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense  that you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a a therapist or just a room full of of drugs you know I mean you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something that you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing  you know better than I that I have been I mean  it is sort of a good it has its ups and downs you know I'm applying for jobs 5-6 jobs or more a day you know I never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to 2 to being self-sufficient again it's hard but that's like real world problems I feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control so now it's just I have to deal with real life witches  Jazz at the juices don't own challenge  it was probably you know a couple of years ago  I was I mean the thing that immediately comes to mind is everything was going well at my job I was making these great videos with this person that I ate that I was having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a Christmas tree  and we spent it all this time picking out the perfect Christmas tree and it was just  feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger  the bigger life  that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel  you know for that instant I felt like  a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and  I mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant I felt like a normal person a normal happy person and  part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that  I don't know if I'll ever feel that again  so  what are you most proud of in your life  probably the  probably this educate educational series I did educational video series I did for the National Science Foundation  it was it was really hard and it would but in the end it turned out really good and you know I'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about  in about the world around them so that I feel like that was a real contribution that I made to the world  I was part of you know it's part of my my job it was it was a we were trying to come up with with new ideas for because we were put together videos and stuff to give you know to two schools and everything and they had done this before but we decided to do something really big you know when there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of  and there was a lot to it and so it was probably the biggest  project that the NSF has decided to do and so we just kind of produced it  I guess  I don't know I don't know it's been awhile it's been awhile since I've since I've really thought about that I don't know what I'd go somewhere would I  I don't know  thank you  Audi
379,male,0,2,all right  thank you  are you okay with this yes  if you want okay little bit tired but for the most part feeling pretty good  I'm actually originally from Woodland Hills which is out in the San Fernando Valley was born there and then I moved to Lomita which is in Los Angeles County about probably around 1993 so I'm going to 23 now so it's about what is 19 years or so I've been living there now  some things that I really like I would have to say you know the beach you know not so much the traffic don't really care for that but definitely you know just kind of like The Nightlife you know just people in general I like conversing with others so  right dip  you travel  yeah actually I do I mean I can't see your shoes but yeah actually I do travel a lot I've been to places like Hawaii been to the Caribbean I've been to see you know just different places like Arizona I've been to Oregon Washington pretty much all over I would say so but usually mainly like why the Caribbean Mexico as well so yep  I think it's just the experience you know I'd like you can't you can kind of experience the culture of different people you know just just the whole background the scenery it's just you know it's it's something new to experience I would say something that you know people haven't seen before so  will it see I recently took a trip to Hawaii a couple months ago I was back in December was around Christmas time New Year's so that was pretty fun we went to a couple different Islands we went to let's see I think it was Kawaii went to Oahu Maui you know places like that so  you know I would have to say that you know probably like in Hawaii or like the Caribbean you know just like I said before the whole experience Factor just seeing you know new different things things that are unique so  actually study journalism right now I'm in my final semester so I'm about to graduate couple months  skip  well you know it's kind of funny cuz you know I started off at a two-year Community College and so you know I was going into my business management something to do with you know I think basically accounting but you know I kind of figured that wasn't for me so I decided to go into journalism because I couldn't I mean you know it probably still be sitting at a desk but you know Lisa journalism I can go on the field and I'll talk to people and you know you know receive information gathering information that sort of deal and then you don't write up stories I just thought it was you I was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to you know just kind of crunching numbers all day so  my dream job I would have to say you know something something and maybe radio broadcasting sports broadcasting you know I think that would be really interesting something that's definitely a passion of mine so  tell me about your relationship with you  my relationship with my family it's it's pretty good you know I lose my parents still like I said I'm 23 years old you know there's certain times when I can be a little bit shaky little bit Rocky but for the most part it's it's pretty good you know I've matured a lot in the last few years so things are getting back up to speed I would say things are things are going pretty well  you know I think it's them somewhere kind of in the middle you know sometimes I can be very outgoing and talkative the people when I'm relaxed and laid-back other times I kind of it's not so much like I go into my shell but you know it's times like I can be kind of shy if I don't know people as well or if I haven't never met them before so it's one of those things that Kanye kind of got to meet me in the Middle with it because you know I can neither be talked very talkative or a x you know I can be a little bit shy but you know once I once I get the conversation going really talkative then so  hey  I'm you know usually I would listen to music or you know maybe just you know can I go for a drive or you know hang out with my friends you know it just something did just the kind that you know he's he's that cuz you know like I said sometimes you get a little bit you know tense and you just want to relax and you know just do the things that you enjoy so  you know I've actually been better with that couple years back unite points were like I pretty much couldn't control my temper like whatsoever and I I mean I would just pretty much get angry you know the littlest things everything would just kind of ticked me off but you know I've definitely learned to you no control that sort of thing and you know it may be a better person because of it  well let's see I'm trying to think it's it was probably something with my family with my mother maybe I can't remember off the top of my head but you know it's it's always something so minuscule that that's why I probably don't remember it but you eventually we make up and I apologize for it because you know I accept that you know I'm wrong and you know certain circumstances  when you feel guilty about  something that I feel guilty about probably you know not being as nice to others as I could have been in the past you know I mean that is the past and you know I don't like this wall in that sort of thing but I think that's one thing that I tried to work on but it's also one thing that I kind of regret not doing just being just being nice  Precision I ever had to make a pretty recent kind of tough because I actually have a buddy he was in the Air Force and you recently got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia so that was really tough and it's hard for me to talk to him because you know he's not really all there anymore like we used to be so it's one of those things where I feel like I'm kind of ignoring him and I don't want to do that but at the same time I don't know is Tennessee's you could be a little crazy so  probably like me on some sort of like traumatic stress disorder maybe when he was in the military so I don't know but yeah  yeah it's pretty tough and I cuz we go way back been best friends with them since I was about five six years old so it's just it's just really hard to deal with but you know I try to I don't I don't you know try to keep in the back of my mind but you know it's it's always there I don't ever forget so  your best friend  my best friend  well you probably say that you know I'm a pretty pretty down-to-earth guy usually pretty honest sometimes brutally honest but you know I try to work on that to you probably say that I'm pretty funny I like to hang out you know just kind of do things here and there you know I'm just normal activities like any other person you know go to the beach hang out watching movies and I'll grab a few beers I started deal so  yeah it varies sometimes it's easier than others you know if I'm really tired and you know I'll probably have a very good sleep I've been sleeping all that great the last few days cuz you know my house there's workers on the roof so they're you're putting in the new Roofing so that's kind of tough that always wakes me up early in the morning so sometimes a little bit crabby but for the most part usually get pretty good sleep  feeling lately lately I feel pretty good you know because you know things are starting to look up I actually got an internship about a month ago for you know my field of Journalism so that's good about to graduate in two months so I'm looking forward to that I'm starting to make a little bit more money that's you know that's good and yeah things are just going pretty well right now I can't complain  yeah it's it's not bad you know like I said it could always be worse right but you know I'm enjoying life so that's the that's the best part  I've not know  nope  last time I felt really happy man you know it was probably going back to my buddy when you know he was still still had a sanity I guess you could say I came back to visit from the Air Force you get some leave so you know you're just hanging out no just kicking back having a few beers and just talking about life so that was nice but I miss that you know so  I feel great do you know it because there's nothing like having a best friend and you can have conversation you know 24/7 about anyting you tell anything to him in confidence and you can tell me anything in confidence is like it's hard to find especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now so  is there any regret  yeah there there's a probably one or two things that I regret well I mean I got a DUI about three or four years ago actually was four years ago that's something that I definitely regret because you know I look back on it and you know things might have been different but at the same time you have to accept you know the actions no circumstances that took place so you know I may end up in you. I guess I think I better off for it but at the same time you know it's always going to be in the back of my mind like I said it's just one of those things you have to do within your own way  advice would you give yourself  well you know it's one of those things like I was a child then so I really don't know what to say I mean even if I would have listened then who knows but you know I probably would have told myself you know just be careful you don't make sure you can be the best person you possibly can candy basically you know just always be nice be honest just be caring for others so  probably going back to my buddy with the whole paranoid schizophrenic thing I don't say that I wish I could erase it I just wish that it didn't happen like that so  send your ideal weekend my dear weekend I usually keep it pretty pretty generic I going to hang out with my friends either you know we hang out in the day no do certain things like you know maybe grab a few beers you know just have casual conversation maybe play games watch movies now just the standard stuff that people do if so  what are some things you wish you could change about you  some things that I wish I could change  probably just you know be nicer like I said before baby not being as lazy have more determination I mean I I have quite a bit of determination I know what I want to do with my life but I know there were times when I kind of get a little lackadaisical and so I wish I could improve upon that and not procrastinate is much so  well you know it's it's tough to think back but I would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad as you know I would say probably like when I was kind of getting angry at certain people maybe just kind of chewing out my friends when I probably shouldn't have I'll try to give him more constructive criticism but at the same time I knew it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things and they were out of characters  okay  the best qualities I would say that I'm definitely hardworking I'm determined a very caring now More Than I Used to Be  very honest and you know I just I love to talk to people like I like making new relationships I like making people laugh  something that I did recently that I really enjoyed you know it's probably over at my internship I was just going to write a story or two and it just felt good you know to get those stories done eventually they're going to go into the paper so I feel accomplished about that you know it's one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product right there you know it's right in your face and you can tell yourself you don't like I did that so makes me feel good  you know just let's see a few different stories that just usually things about will the papers in Long Beach so it's usually about you know stories are events that are taking place in Long Beach so  I would say that I'm most proud of you know graduating high school. Graduate college hopefully you know I was going to earn a degree and then hopefully get a good solid job you know the near future I think that's one thing that I'm most proud of  thank you  so we value your feedback so  after you take care with your answer

468,male,0,4,<synch> yes i'm okay with this i'm pretty good feeling a little tired but uh feeling pretty good for the most part um redondo beach yep i like the beach i like the mountains i love how you could go surfing in the morning go snowboarding in the day um i like to go hiking up in these mountains santa monica mountains to be exact i don't like the traffic i don't like the congestion of people here and i don't like the price of <o> the cost of living in specific areas uh i've been trying to actually um last year was the summer of really road tripping and getting out there with my girlfriend um we're looking to go to costa rica and hopefully to south america this summer and then maybe even doing a road trip down the south see some of the southern states but uh i've been to canada i've been to mexico and ecuador and been to various states here and there trying to get out there i love meeting new people i love experiencing new things trying different <diffing> different foods that are native to that local area and it's just part of the journey i just i love exploring this you know this planet we call earth um just recently we went to seattle and canada with a couple friends and uh it was gorgeous we uh flew into seattle and we saw the city for the first two three days and then rented a car and headed over to vancouver canada and saw british columbia and boy was it gorgeous just very lush beautiful trees the uh the climate was nice the ocean was right there it was people were great it was just a fun trip all around yeah <deep breath> <sigh> one of my most memorable <sigh> memorable experiences was probably the uh the trip we took to colorado last summer and uh me and my girlfriend flew into denver and we didn't really have a plan we knew we knew of a couple people who were living there and um just the day before we had to uh contacted them and telling 'em we're coming in the area and they were just showed great hospitality they picked us up at the airport let us crash at their place for a couple days we even let us use their car to explore the state and go to wyoming and see the the neighbors to the north it was just a great trip great people and it was just everything worked out very well just every day was there was something new and fun to do yeah i uh i studied business management and uh economics right now um i've always wanted to own my own business and i figured management be a a good uh foundation to build on and uh learn more about so i decided to go into management just to see the various aspects of what it takes to really manage your own business and um and then economics is just to just for long term investments i really wanted to start earning some stocks and e_t_fs and mutual funds and start buidling my portfolio up so i figured economics would be a great way for a long term investment financially so that's why i did my economics yeah i'm really stoked it was one of the best decisions probably of my my life yeah i consider myself more outgoing i'm i'm pretty friendly i don't mind to open up to people and stuff <sigh> i like to be outside like to go hiking i like to go um working out at the gym but i mostly like to be outdoors i i love nature and just to be outside just just puts me at ease from pretty good for the most part i'm pretty mellow chill guy and when i do get angry here and there i uh it just lasts for like a couple minutes and before i know it i just it just blows over i don't tend to hold on to things or stay angry and hold grudges just 'cause there's no need to life's too short for all that um see i can't even remember the last time i argued with anybody i have no idea probably when my uh my brother and my girlfriend got in a little little argument uh like two birthdays ago and it's been awkward kinda ever since um i wish i would've just handled it right then and there rather than it letting it just stretch out as long as it has been it's just awkward for both parties i wish i just would've communicated with both of them and told 'em to you know set their differences aside and let's just communicate and try to see we come up with a solution but now it's just awkward yeah it does the hardest decision i've ever had to make man that's a toughy i don't think i've had too many tough decisions to really say the hardest decision i've ever had to make um maybe not moving to colorado for my undergrad two three years ago was a little tough just 'cause i kinda think what if but other than that nothing has really been too tough in my life that was really that hard of a decision i don't really feel guilty about anything pretty good person i think and for the most part i couldn't think of anything something i could wish i could erase from my memory um nothing really to be honest i i love all my memories they're usually positive for the most part i know that's kinda weird for somebody to say but i've lived a pretty good life and i'm happy yeah uh it's cool um i'm pretty independent for the most part so when i do see 'em here and there it's it we go through long periods of times with no contact maybe a couple weeks sometimes even a month but uh when i see 'em it's it's good you know i like to say hi and show 'em i love 'em still and it's not that i don't mean to like not contact 'em they could always contact me but uh it's good for the most part i guess as a young adult mm my girlfriend's family uh they've been very positive in my life uh if it wasn't for them i think i'd be in a different direction just 'cause in high school i didn't really care about higher education i didn't care about really thinking long term and uh just seeing them <th> them and what their family does and how they think differently like with your higher education and how to get somewhere in life and the if you do these things this is what it could lead to and they've been very successful they own their own uh accounting practice and seeing that influenced me to achieve higher in life yeah it's pretty easy for the most part i just close my eyes and wake up in the morning i'm tired sometimes i'm could sense that i'm a little drained and uh maybe get a little groggy here and there and that's it feeling pretty good for the most part a little stressed out just 'cause finals are uh next week and uh i really really wanna do well and just you know close out this last semester and i graduate in two weeks and um for the most part that's that's the only thing i'm really nervous about but for the most part i'm really excited i'm looking forward to going to maui for a week after graduation i'm fired up i'm fired up to see what the future holds where we gonna live <l> me and my girlfriend gonna live and what other trips are planned for the summer i'm just i'm excited to be done with school for a little while yeah i have never been diagnosed with p_t_s_d i've never been diagnosed with depression <sigh> the last time i felt really happy was probably seeing my girlfriend graduate a couple days ago she had uh just graduated from nursing school on monday and uh to see her walk across stage and stuff just 'cause we've been together for six years and seeing her go through the nursing program for five and it's just seeing all the ups and downs it's really good to see somebody just strive through and achieve what they want to achieve and just made me really proud of her yeah probably outgoing friendly positive vibes all around adventurous loves sports team player knows how to be a leader here and there and uh gets a little outspoken sometimes no not really for the most part no not really just be a little more motivated i used to be so motivated and right now i'm just maybe 'cause i'm just done with school and i'm over it that i just don't feel as motivated but i just i wanna be more motivated and determined right now and that's not i'm not going that way right now so mhm no biggie <sigh> oh man i couldn't can't really think of a time i went caving two weeks ago that was a lot of fun uh we went up to sequoia national park and uh i went caving with a for an r_t_m class it's like this uh recreational tourism management class and caving was an elective and our professor was like a world renowned cave specialist and he took us to these various caves in uh sequoia and just me and these strangers or my classmates and becoming really good friends at the end was a lot of fun and rappelling down into caves climbing back up going through different rooms and chutes it was a lot of fun that was yeah ten or twenty years ago i'd probably say just stay more focused on school a little less on the social aspects and uh kinda stick with one sport just to see how far that could get ya um <sigh> sometimes not playing hockey through uh through middle school and hockey sometimes <someti> i mean through middle school and high school sometimes and um and that's pretty much it now i'm proud <sigh> that uh i'm really proud that i'm graduating getting my bachelor's and i'm looking to get a full time job i work at a law firm now so i have something going for me  um i'm really proud to be a motivated and determined person long term wise <w> long term thinking wise i'm a well-rounded person and i really wanna explore the world so i'm kinda proud that i opened my eyes to that and now i have different perspectives and really have a open mind to people and rather than judging 'em you know it's liberty why not let 'em do what they want and uh i'm really proud to just be finally getting my bachelor's and hopefully going for my m_b_a in a couple years for sure bye
372,female,1,13,okay and please  are you okay with  Des  come  pretty good kind of  Los Angeles  the thing I like about ale the weather  what are some things you don't really  it's not easy to meet people  can you tell me about  well it just feels like people aren't out very much they're like that movie in Crash where people are just in their cars all the time it feels like that  no  not too much  child development  well I have a son and I wanted to know how to be a good mom and so I wanted to know about the stages that he would be going through and be able to relate better to him  are you happy  I am  kind of I'm trying to get it started again in the fall  I love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me  I like the right  tell me about that  I've written some children's books and I've just been doing research looking and so getting my books published it's only like two that I've written so far but they're pretty good I got some good feedback on them for my critique groups  it's about  a little boy that surrounded by people that are jerks and he tries to not become a jerk with him and if it's a bit like a really  he goes through a lot of moods dealing with the people in his life  you find it easy to be a parent  I know I have had some issues with nervous breakdowns actually and right now my son is staying with his dad so I know I was single mom it was the hardest thing I think in the world  so  how do I cope  all right now  I didn't have very many coping skills are mechanisms so  that was the problem  it's so spontaneous  make the stuff that comes out of kids mouth sometimes and the stuff that they do and just brings a smile to your face  well when I said was younger  once we were just sitting around the house and he comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me Mom I want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails so you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend  so  yeah pretty spontaneous things like that happen that my kids telling me I need to not be single anymore  okay  the hardest thing  not wanting to screw it up  have a lot of stress and pressure  that  every little thing is going to be in make a difference in matter  and what kind of person like it turns out to be  and  so  it's a lot of stress on yourself  yeah  yeah definitely  I think  I'm different from my mom  because I'm a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction I welcome it you know I welcome  getting to know who my child is right now and  not try to mold them into somebody that I want them to be but just see them become the best child that they can be the best adult that they can be without molding them in that direction necessarily into a different person  say it again  who someone that's a positive influence  I don't really have anybody  like that  what I'm feeling  I turn on the fish tank screensaver  hey I know it's not a lie but it's the best I've got  what do you do to relax  well  I've tried to meditate sometimes but I don't really stick with it often enough  I've tried to like go for walks but I don't always do that and I will always stick with it  so  that's about it  I say  I'm a little below average meaning that I get angry more than most people do I think  when was the  last night it was on the telephone I was arguing with my husband we have my sister lives with us and she lives with us in a very small room with a small apartment I should say and she's got four people living in one room so  it's kind of stressful it's really crowded and my husband is stressed out about it and you know I'm just saying to him that I told you so I told you if my sister moved in here  they said there was going to be a mess in the house and she's going to be asking for things you don't really want to do that's just how my sister is so the house is messy and it's crowded and everyday they're asking for brides and my husband he's avoiding coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't want to be there anymore and I just saying that he's going to have to find a way to deal with it because  he asked for it in my opinion  where does  oh I got time to Bumble right now  but now my mind is losing custody of my son right now like I've been arguing with my stepmom and my step-sister for a long time about my son and how they treat him and how I want them to be treated like they don't have any boundaries  and I believe that boundaries are important in establishing who's the adult who's the child they let my child boss them around and stuff anyways because of this they're going to be testifying against me in the custody trial saying that  yeah there any saying that I'm not a good mom because I believe in having boundaries and we had very different ideas about child-raising she's my stepmom she's my dad's death wife  and she's  she really does it she's really far removed from how I was raised and I want to raise my child more similar to how I was raised where you we had some independent that we had some boundaries that we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us  where's my stepmom she invents no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild and have everything that he wants and that's fine with your grandparents but the problem is that I live with him sometimes and when I'm in the same house with them they should be following my rules and not  trying to go and break all of my rules  anyway  yam  in that moment  just really frustrated because they don't listen to me  I fell  disrespected I feel like invisible I feel  just angry  that they're taking away my right to pair it and it's something that I worked really hard to do I went to school and I study Child Development I read all the magazines and I read the books and I really  I know what I'm talkin about I feel confident and my parenting skills in my parenting abilities and they have these people that have it done the same thing I worked as hard as I have to be a good parent try and tell me that I'm a bad parent  it's really  hard to believe so I feel very disrespected and acknowledge angry frustrated  all those things  I take I take Benadryl to help me sleep  and I'm so  my doctor gave me that give you Benadryl told me I can take it to help me sleep  last night I was crying  before I went to sleep  so what time do you start start running through your head at night when you're in bed  but I tried to push them out and then I got up and I took my Benadryl so I can go to sleep more easily  I need triggered by something  yeah I'm always thinking about my son  I wish you was with me  and how unfair everything is it's happening  I like I don't deserve  do you have my son taken from me because I'm a really good mom you know  and I'm too hard on myself so  but I am a good mom and I feel confident that I'm a good mom or Jess  I don't really have the money to take care of my son like my dad to send dad does he has more money than me  and right now I'm trying to be okay with it because  I know he can do more for him  financially than I could  that doesn't mean I'm not a good mom  I'm pretty depressed I'm on antidepressants  take Wellbutrin I've been on it for a couple weeks now  I think they're working I don't know I'm not as  down as I was I mean I got here today I got dressed and I'm here today so...  my husband complains a lot he says  I'm not the same person  that I was when he married me  he said it was fun and I was positive and  I was all these other optimistic things that's another thing is on the phone telling you last night and  and  I'm not those things anymore which is true I mean we got married a year ago  and that my son was taken shortly after and it was just such  a shock  and  I've just been trying to get back from it  but it's been hard  did I think I had a problem before I found out  found out what  oh  yeah I like crying a lot sometimes I cry all the time  play  my family would invite me to family events  and I would go and just just cry because my son wasn't there  toram  I don't know  it's just all the crying I think and like I said my husband letting me know that I'm not the same person  so  he's disappointed that I feel bad even that I'm not the same person that he knew I feel bad about that to another thing I'm feeling bad about you know  you still go to therapy now  yes I do I try  I feel like the therapist useful  yeah it's nice to talk about your problems I go in there and I cry every week so I need to have a set time every week where I can go in and cry  that's I mean it's a release to be able to cry sometimes I feel better afterwards  yeah  and she helps me make decisions you know  help me to be more proactive in my life  well I'm looking for  jobs and things like that and she gives me ideas of why don't you work here why don't you work there have you thought about this or that you know and then she said something about how did you go back to school at so I went and applied to go back to school you know I'm not doing much with my life and sitting around all day isn't helping my depression any either  so I'm trying to find a work and I applied for college  in the fall I got accepted to Dominguez Hills  so I may be going back to school in the fall right now I'm still looking for work but she helps me with that kind of stuff just giving me ideas  that life isn't over there still more you know I could be doing this like like yeah  everything's always bittersweet  I don't know  last time it was really happy  I don't know  my ideal weekend  oh  I don't have a lot of money cuz I'm not working right now so really my weekends are just fed  reading maybe that I can't believe I can't pay much attention when I'm reading have a short attention span I can only read a couple of chapters  but lately I say that's what I've been doing is reading  something I read  okay  I need to go to USC they have these nights were  they have things like book signings or poetry and art is called Visions & voices so I like to go out to their events  and I usually enjoy those  about two weeks ago Deborah Harkness was there doing a book signing for a discovery of witches  so like I said I'm trying to be a writer so I try to go especially to the book signings  and see what it's like to be an officer who's talking to a crowd and signing books  what

Of time doing math and reading and not talking anybody message.  I guess I play video games or it'll work out I work out I think a lot I try to at least  I rolled my eyes which happened towards a bad thing and let's put it I think  bad parenting basically parents are more self-centered more than themselves and representations and the kids just do they won't be compared to Art their opinion  I guess  thank you  I only have best friend  it's a remember  unbiased obviously but they are  I really good math I'm not really sure if you can't that's why you can't get better than that but thing is it's just have to get recertified conference with it where no matter what it is going to learn in math class. Out I am patient I think and I am just went where I can swim I can spend many hours many many many hours would be books that might not be important but they might be important to do anyway that's a bad thing  when I a good workout  Google video game small little things like that when something happens when my not researched I think mathematical physics type thing where it goes well that must put a book that puts me in a good mood  thank you  right now  is it that that  research that I did I did make it this far  research why that's all  that's all  interesting  we start off in school read about I say things like that he's a general tutoring hero particle physics and no idea what it is you know it's very complicated because iCloud mechanics and you still have that and but you not sure if I should make it and eventually he still has lot of time goes by you reach you as time goes on you can get closer closer emission Mexico I miss you realize you are just men as good as we are up there you can do research and visit you can't admit knowledge  okay  a few weeks ago when I got a good grade in the class  thank you  yes briefly  many years ago  I don't know she's always growing up I always thought I was always thought Dreamworld the kid that's why and I just we're not doing that  I was National Guard or I think about 18 19 I got commissioned at2021 as longing for about a year so I let it 2022  yes. Really  I don't think it did I think I just need to grow up your butt or expecting to be as much  graduate school  in physics  no  nope  it depends when I work out really hard at night of the day of the day before if I work out pretty hard as bad if I don't workout it I don't know it's hard moderately  thank you  yes  it's okay  probably like I am now normal I think not as not as happy about everything was still pretty okay still function  no  hey sliding  no  yes  yes I have changed my thoughts  applying to grad school games been a while and slightly apprehensive happy that looks good but every answer is that it might not be good things like that  what do you mean by that is I know so you could Peter but I didn't how hard to do these thoughts or how hard is it going to grad school  understand  okay  I agree  no not really  how to keep doing what you do even though I'm not that old believe it or not 20 years ago was probably 15 kit for 12 workout if I work if it was a little bit different don't think it'll work out so well it was a perfect now they were doing really well personally  thank you  same here  goodbye  I'll keep this on  take us off now
401,female,0,9,<sync> yes i'm okay i'm good i'm a little tired but i'm good michigan i'm from michigan um a long time ago then i left uh once twice a year cold <laughter> very cold because i wanted to pursue my acting career uh well it wasn't a hard decision it was just it was the weather it was the opportunity it was the options more options uh the driving has been a pain in the butt not so easy <sigh> let's see besides the weather i like that things are more convenient i like some of the people here um <laughter> that are actually from home but um yeah i i just i like i like that it's a little laid back that's about it i don't like the traffic i don't like um uh the gang violence in certain areas and i don't like <sigh> what else don't i like huh maybe that's that's all i don't like i don't oh you know i like i don't like that it's so far away from home i wish i wish l_a was kinda midwest <laughter> i wish it wasn't so far from home i have a close relationship with my family um it's a small uh immediate family is really small and we're close my grandmother recently passed so it's um <tisk> an adjustment right now but i'm close to my family well i can't see your shoes but i do travel often i do travel yes um getting there <laughter> i like getting there um once i'm at the wherever i'm going i like to actually do the tourist thing get to know places and people uh okay i oh i went to um france a few years ago well many years ago and a little town called carcassonne and was very um it was it was actually really fun but very much like a story book as far as what i expected to see and what i actually saw like i what i remember that i really enjoyed was that at night when everybody closes up like there are no windows in the buildings but they are these shutters that most places in the united states have inside of windows they have them outside of the windows and there's no glass so you just shut and it looks like everything is abandoned like the buildings are abandoned so pretty cool <sniff> i like that <laughter> i'm borderline sometimes i'm shy sometimes i'm outgoing it depends on who  and what the situation is <laughter> um music i turn on music i walk through the neighborhoods you know i'm pretty good at controlling my temper i'm not a um hot head at all hm oh it was an ex roommate and it was about my loyalty as a friend yeah um pretty much she um thought that because i wanted my rent which she agreed to pay that i was not being a good friend that i should just let her live for free and that wasn't going to happen so you know the loyalty came with letting you stay anyway or letting her stay anyway even after she didn't pay me so that's a friend i could've kicked her out i didn't she left at the agreed time after she let me know that she was not going to pay but you know could've um could've could've been a bad situation but there was an argument there a real a real one i wish i had handled that situation differently and followed my first mind when we agreed to be roommates temporarily and um gotten my money upfront that's what i wish i had done and i just i didn't my mind told me to go along with it no my mind told me to get the money upfront but i didn't so mm the hardest decision um i think i have yet to make the hardest decision but so far like <tisk<> maybe um leaving home leaving home when i was years ago when i was like eighteen yeah um i felt like i was abandoning my family <laughter> that's what i felt <laughter> but um they encouraged me to go on and live my life mhm uh something that i could erase from my memory probably a friend who i was um uh dating i would like to erase from my memory how he responded to me when i told him my grandmother um was ill um it's easy if i'm busy all day and i'm really really tired but actually my mind spins so it's not that easy actually it's not that easy i'd have to because i have to be exhausted i have to be exhausted to be exhausted no it's not really hard you just do a lot of stuff all day long irritable up and down up and up and down like sometimes i've been excited and anxious and on the other side i'm like mm what am i doing yeah it's just an anxiousness to wanna make some things happen some goals and um uh getting certain kind of work and um having a certain amount of um income and uh just taking care of myself you know the way i think i should take care of myself just the physical stuff eating right and everything yeah i have um sometimes i have a lot of distracting thoughts that have nothing to do with what i need to be focused on in the moment and i'm conscious of that i'm like of all the things that's popping up in my head why am i thinking about that uh i i let them happen and then i i try to think about other things and phase it out it pops back up i phase it out yeah no no uh when the roommate moved out i was really happy when she finally left <laughter> um probably reading and maybe go out go dancing that would be ideal i can go dancing go salsa dancing and yeah mm my ability to make a decision quicker and to act on it really badly uh i don't know if i have a time that someone has ever made me feel really badly i don't feel bad about much uh as courageous that would be it in a nutshell <laughter> in general um i regret not making some different decisions when i was younger as far as moving forward with as far as um career stuff and um relationship things i wish i had done some things earlier in my life that i'm doing now uh really going after some of my personal goals and um deciding to actually be in a relationship that's long term and yeah i wish i had done that earlier <laughter> twenty years ago i would have giving given myself the advice to um continue with my schooling um beyond what i did and to be more discerning in my choices of individuals who i allow in my life um being a part of the family that i'm a part of <laughter> thank you goodbye
338,female,1,15,yes  i'm doing fine  i'm from los angeles california  wow wonderful weather um outdoor activities all the time too crowded pollution  the norm  i studied child communications um recently i just i would say yes preschool teacher  well i've always worked with children ever since i was eighteen years old so i figured doing something helping someone it doesn't pay well but you're investing in the future  wow some job that i could get paid to be outside all day get paid well to be outside all day  yes  i'm kinda quiet but i also like i probably would say borderline i like outside activities but i mainly kinda do um activities probably by myself so yeah i would say i'm an introvert slightly uh wow just um maybe a racist or disrespectful person i kinda shut down and and reevaluate how i am as a person how i'm coming off to other people i can't change anyone else's personality but i can work on my own   i'm pretty good  i usually don't argue with people i usually walk away i mean a argument doesn't settle anything  wow it's a lot of things i regret but it's not anything that i can control probably the biggest regret was losing my mother  thank you  i was extremely close to my mother that was who i am as a person who made me as a person  wow twenty ten years ago i would tell myself not to be so angry so  upset all the time about things i can't control i would tell myself to relax and not be so hard on myself  i think that's pretty cool i think you should have different avenues to deal with different people   <clears throat> no i have not  no i have not  yes  um less than a month  i realized i have to evaluate myself as a person so i can't really look to anyone else to help me unless i i start with myself no i don't  i feel like as a person as uh a individual i feel like i should be able to control things myself i feel like to go seek out help is good for someone else it probably is very good for other people i've worked with that population of p_t_s_d um veterans before so i know that it helps a lot of people but i don't feel like it's for me it's not difficult at all i've always been like a loner someone who who tries to handle <ha> to handle my own problems and situations  a little depressed but i think everyone is it has a little bit of sadness in them at some point   day by day day by day i just started a exercise program so i'm trying to look at myself  for the solution  always known ever since i was a child things moved me differently than other kids so i felt like i was always different i felt like if i was gonna ever understand me as a person then i would have to work on myself so yes  um today i got to see my best friend after a long time so i mean happiness comes and goes but i felt happy today  wow he would say really silly um  but still when i'm around him i try to be happy i try to present a a a situation where we're both gonna be happy no one wants to be around a depressed person  scrubbed_entry wow i mean on certain days everything could be my best quality but i would say um i'm loyal i'm dependable um  i would just say i try to be there in the moment i'm not a person who who is really fat flashy <f> excuse me uh flashy or into materialistic things so i feel like i'm very grounded  oh my mother by far my sisters  uh my mom was a school teacher which made me wanna become a school teacher and that's basically what i have been doing uh my sister has been at her job for forty years so i've always had a stable influence in my life  wow i would say just sitting on a sunny nice day talking to my mother i would say that would bring a smile to my face immediately   wonderful  wonderful  i like to get out and play sports i play four or five different sports and um i like to go for a walk i like to ride my bike i like to get out and be active  having such a wonderful mother i mean i have to keep going back to that subject because we're introduced into this life and that's our first teacher that's our first teacher and it's gonna be our teacher for a very long time and uh i'm just very thankful i'm very proud to have had such a wonderful woman as my mother riding my bike simple things going for a walk with my sister exercising  uh just last sunday  well thank you 
344,male,0,11,yes i'm okay  i'm from uh los angeles california originally  yes sunshine uh the weather's great  it's about it smog pollution crime um  certain things like that yeah  i did in one point in my life i was in the military so don't do hardly a lot of traveling no more  seeing different sights different people i think it's more the people and being around different types a city and the people <peop> see meeting different new people  uh <sigh> i traveled to uh  new york one time and uh it was quite different big city  different people  uh that's about it  eighteen  uh yes i was <laughter>  uh no i did a lot of combat training but no combat  mm disciplined more uh more motivated uh you get a lot of things done more <laughter> even when you don't wanna do 'em you know you just go back to your army days and you get motivated off the stuff that that that you really needed to get done but you didn't wanna do it but it got done uh like uh  you had to uh do a lot of cleaning uh you had to wake up pretty early you had to do a lot of p_t you had to uh stay up to like two three o'clock in the morning you didn't wake back up until four or five yes <y> uh <laughter> to a certain point yes  after the military i joined the national guard and i did uh fifteen sixteen years in there uh i was uh excuse me ma'am i didn't hear that <th> quite hear that uh what made me decide to do that  uh just the motivation just you know really wanted a career see if i could find a career from it and it helped me out a little bit yeah    thank you  it wasn't that easy  uh i mean i'm sorry it was easy it didn't bother me too much to go back to civilian life  yeah it didn't bother me at all i just <ju> i adjusted pretty well  uh <sigh> history basically a lot um  yeah just basically history  uh no i'm not i'm uh disabled oh no it's okay it's okay we can all i can heal i can get better hopefully i will  yes i try to keep a  excuse me ma'am i guess i don't  my dream job would probably be working with others working with young people working with kids seeing that they get the uh the right and proper uh uh education that's you know that's due to them so they can be productive in the life of society as we live in today  yeah  excuse me  <sigh> what i think about 'em i think uh they should uh be more more uh <sigh> xxx i mean they should they should <sh> participate <tapicitate> more in what they're doing in their lives they should ask more questions they should be more motivated to uh really achieve something within their lives to give them the mm to give them the confidence and the motivation they need in life 'cause a lot of 'em don't get it <sigh> when i see people do really really stuff that they really shouldn't be doing  uh <sigh> it really eeks me i mean really bothers me and when people talk to you they give you the run-around it's like won't you just be straight with me instead of just giving me the the run-around <laughter> won't you just be straight up with me that can be very frustrating uh and really when people do really i'm trying to find the right word stupid stuff <laughter> that really botthers me too   uh spray painting on the wall  uh just throwing garbage anywhere and not picking it up uh not really being uh you know not really being  hygiene you know taking care of yourself and being hygiene you know what i mean  yeah  <sigh> what i do when i'm annoyed uh i get really upset i really start really cussing people out to be honest with you and it's something that's not really me but uh i'm learning to really let go of it a lot you know just you know just say hey that's the way it is it's like i'm not in control i can't control it yeah i have only have to control the things about what i do and really getting upset off of what other people do is not really good it's not good for me oh my temper can be controlled i can control it pretty well  uh  i i don't know i think it probably was my sister and she's very controlling and it's like you have your life and i have mine don't tell me what to do yeah  we real close i can get along with 'em we're real close i have no problems with them   yeah very good  uh  this morning <laughter>  yeah i wake up pretty you know i i first thing i do when i wake up in the morning i pray so when my spirit's in connection with the uh <sigh> the universe and the world i i feel pretty good   yes  uh <sigh> up and down you know up because i'm motivated to get out and start doing other things in life than just not doing anything at all and then other times where you wanna get something accomplished and you can't really get it done because there's road blocks in the way but uh i'm learning how to uh overcome those road blocks as well uh  well for instance uh looking to go to school and i was having problems uh getting enrolled in school i was talk to one of my social workers and she was willing to help me get online and uh to do it so i'm like okay it's well it's gonna get done <laughter> yeah  uh can you repeat that one more time ma'am  uh yes i have  see i had to be uh <sigh> i'd say uh for the last couple of weeks uh i noticed that i go through certain situations like you was talking about the anger situation it's like i don't get angry all the time that's not me so sometimes when i get angry i have to find out what's causing all this what's what's causing me to get angry  and i have to take  excuse me ma'am  uh it's not hard at all 'cause alls you have to do is just take your time and reflect about everything uh that you have gone through and uh take a good look at the situation and uh and then go from there and find out what's what's really bothering you  it's very seldom  uh i suffer from p_t_s_d and uh getting that type of sleep would be would be great  because i have recurring nightmares so of a incident so  <sigh> i i think it is and i don't know what it's triggered by but i think it is and that's why i'm talking to someone or seeing someone 'cause i'm a veteran  at the uh v_a about the situation now about the p_t_s_d basically right now  excuse me ma'am  uh <sigh> a lot of nightmares lot of problems lot of anger issues uh depression uh i noticed all this in me and uh i started i just started to just tell myself i needed help  and that's that's basically it i just you know i just you know i just something wasn't wrong with it something wasn't right with me  and when something's not right with me i have to take time out to just you know take a good look at myself and ask myself if something's right then you if something's right then that's fine if something's not right then you need to take care of it   and uh i just started seeking help down there yeah  somewhat yes it is somewhat  'cause i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist  well i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist and uh tell 'em my situation and we usually will go over the problem and uh i went to classes i've been to uh uh talking one-on-one with my own doctor so it's helping out a little bit  yeah  it's a good thing excuse me ma'am no no not really  my best friend  uh they he would describe me as a fun loving good person always there that try to help others uh  think more of others really than more of myself but when i know i need things need to be done for me i take care of it so you know and they really actually they really look up to me they have a lot more respect for me yeah they see something in me they wish that they had   excuse me ma'am uh can you be a little bit more specific  oh okay  uh books crossword puzzles uh walking that's about it  i thought i did but i don't think i do i don't think i regret anything because  this is this is how it is this is the way it is for me so i accept it and i keep moving on  because if i regret anything in the past then i'm wasting my time on that because it's gone that's the past i need to move on i need to live in the present so i can be prepared for the future so i can move on to the future  yeah  <sharp inhale> uh <sigh> more education uh  being more direct and more confidence in what i'm doing like i am today so yeah that's what i was lacking maybe twenty years ago  uh yes <ye> yes i have had a lot of positive people been been in my life  uh <sigh> yeah some people would uh uh uh well consistently <cons> xxx i mean consistently motivate me to continue and to pursue a certain goal and uh i thought that was pretty good because i really don't see that a lot and uh he gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do certain things 'cause anything that you do it's a choice it's up to you whether or not if you do it or not that choice is still up to you for it to be done   excuse me ma'am  uh <sigh> that i'm able to really be able to be self-motivated and really be able to put my best foot forward and be able to get a lot of things accomplished which i thought i couldn't but it can be accomplished if i'm willing enough to put the will to it to do it oh wow huh  oh really and you know what i really enjoyed was sitting down with my social worker and we're talking about getting things done within my life and school was one of 'em uh  and just being just school was one of 'em and i kinda liked it that because that was the first time someone was willing to really sit down with me and work with me  yeah and i thought that was a great thing so as long as you're willing to do that i'm willing to go even the extra mile and even be motivated to do other things besides school and uh yeah that and that and that's what gets me going oh it is and i love it and uh this is going to be accomplished  thank you  goodbye 
337,female,1,10,yeah i'm doing okay how are you doing i'm originally from like a suburb <su> a suburb of l_a from the san gabriel valley i like the diversity i like the vibe of the city i've lived other places and it's just not as happy here i feel like i can really thrive here so i just like l_a like all the things that are so close together then there's a lot of interesting things that totally different parts of the city just miles away from each other uh don't like the traffic don't like all the cars but i can live with it i mean there's not that much i don't like i studied music um vocal performance i studied music technology things like that yes right now um i sing in an opera company but my i do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the l_a opera so i do have a day job i work at a call center that caters mostly to performers and actors and things like that and it's really good because if i get a call i can call in and change my shift very easily so it's actually a pretty good gig and i do some uh technology gigs sometimes you know it's do some recording some live sound stuff but i'm kinda wanna get away from that do some video work sometimes but again i wanna get away from that i wanna go back to the  because i find that performing more is more interesting i like being talent more than i like being crew <laughter> so i kinda wanna get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what i wanna do with my life sometimes i mean per my personal life yeah so i do have a shell that i put out there to deal with people but if i'm at home you know i'd kinda rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever talk to family   don't really have too many close friends <clears throat> but yeah you know i'd rather keep to myself uh moderately close to the family that i have left i've actually lost a lot of family in the last ten years or so but like thank you <laughter> but like uh my i'm close to my husband and you know i've got couple of cousins i talk to and my aunt that i have an aunt that i talk to a bit but it's not like we're interacting every day close together  but it's somewhat close mostly i sing or i read or i write or just hang out and try to clear my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesn't work but i try to do that and try to just clear everything and see what starts coming back in and sometimes <ss> sometimes that works sometimes it doesn't but mostly creating things um contacting my family some <so> you know through facebook or whatever works but mostly in my free time i create things i'd like to travel more i like to travel by car a lot um i mean my idea of like having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip and i like to travel more um i would love to travel for work things or whatever but i don't get as much of an opportunity as i would like to to travel seeing <see> uh particularly traveling by car seeing like the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know feeling the vibrations of the area change  i like just seeing what's out there seeing and i know that there's a bigger world outside of  where i am and where i live and my world and i like to see that but i like to leave that too and go back to my own world <laughter> <laughter> <clears throat> um let's see xxx a trip that i like to take is to make the drive from here to nevada whether i go all the way to vegas or just go to state line um my cousin and i would take what we call exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway so we'd take those we'd just   sort of impromptu with like <li> a day or two notice just move things around just take off so those are actually trips that i i like making <mak> 'cause i take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight just small short trips that aren't very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how um you know the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas  so close to home but not but not close to home close to home but uh still a world away so that 'cause i don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever but that's just little things that kinda put things back in perspective and and clear my head and things like that i mean 'cause there's sort of a sense of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway so i i like i like doing that the last time that happened was may of last year that's the last time i was able to do that we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who's ten years younger than i am and we kinda grew up like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland empire which is where they live so they kinda took me on a last hurrah and we drove up to vegas and looked around and came back 'cause i actually lived in vegas for awhile but i didn't like it so they kinda i showed <show> showed them some of the locals sites around there and we came back and was you know an overnight trip but we were driving the entire time <laughter> so it was kind of an interesting uh things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals people who can't fight back and they're mean to them just because they can't fight back   and i actually like to see people who are strong <st> as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate or what have you so i think that's one thing that's makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason you know not people <pe> for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it just that kinda really just makes me mad when i'm annoyed i'll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me then i'll wind up lashing out somehow either   you know verbally just cutting 'em with a quip or you know i mean i i rarely just i rarely will yell at somebody but i'll try to you know if i'll try to walk away and defuse it if that doesn't work then i'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me <laughter> that usually works  not in like legal trouble or anything because usually i'll find a way to get them to leave me alone um so there's not really like big trouble but 'cause i think 'cause it's it it is off-putting and it's not expected <exp> the expected reaction and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction 'cause i know that will work and get people away from me so it's not really in trouble and if  it's is trouble it's usually trouble that it's from their the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because it's usually a situation i can get out of  so as long as they leave me alone you know i don't i i'll walk away from it uh the last time i argued with somebody like person <per> like a person <per> like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my uh the last thing i can think of was i argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law 'cause she's got dementia and so we one of the reasons we came out here from the inland empire was to take care of her 'cause she won't go anywhere but l_a i mean she is like hardcore angelino like you know we we know we are the we're that in our nature but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere <laughter> but um so we came out here to take care of her  and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is 'cause she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process  but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what she wants 'cause he's a mama's boy like i am i'm a mama's girl even though i've lost my mom like four years ago i'm still a mama's girl and i'll still <st> and i still and i know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much and that's what they want so you wanna get it for 'em and because you know they you know that happened when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it  and you wanna do that for them now like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about somebody you feel deserves it but it's kinda dangerous for her you know and i don't want things <thi> something to happen to her yet i want her to remain who she is for as long as she can 'cause i know it the disease that she has is gonna erase who she is eventually and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her twenty four hour medically trained care but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves 'cause it's not that bad but it's getting where she really shouldn't <shou> has no business living by herself anymore so the solution right now is he stays there most the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do i handle the outside things i run the errands i take her to the store things like that he does the day to day things makes sure she has <ha> she eats makes sure she you know has clean clothes things like that so i mean it's a partnership it's a it's a dual effort it's very much a dual effort but i would like her to move in with us so that was that's like a source of it's not really like yelling screaming argument but lively discussion <laughter> you know than debate meh it's not insurmountable i mean life's not gonna be easy ever and if it is that's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you so as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life it's not gonna be easy but you deal with it and you you move on uh the most positive influence i think have been probably my mother and my grandmother 'cause my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually gave me a lot of confidence and but were realistic about it so i mean i think i have sort of a realistic sort of a downer temperment <laughter> to myself but they but they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something i can't get over and that you know life's gonna go on you know my mom would say to me when you're forty you're forty whether you're working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life and i think that was a big influence on how i lived have how i've lived my life since she's passed   i regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because i think it may have clouded some of my decisions now i do have underlying conditions and everybody in my family is diabetic and i didn't take care of that when she was the last year of her life 'cause i was too busy wanting to get her home my focus was to get her home so i didn't eat right i didn't take my insulin right um i wound up making myself insulin resistant that that year just 'cause my blood sugar was so high for eh like a year eating just horrible foods when i did eat so it really took a toll and i really actually made myself very sick  and i'm wondering well if i didn't if i would've taken care of myself and i had my head on completely straight and my my vision <vi> my vision and my thoughts weren't completely <complete> weren't clouded would i have made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed 'em and when she needed me to be to step in and make the decisions for her because she  uh wound up having a health catastrophe 'cause she had kidney well she had kidney damage that wound up being kidney failure and her health insurance provider missed that so she wound up having sort of this whole catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down she wound up having a stroke at like fifty one she had had a small stroke and it just kinda went down from there so i'm thinking well if i didn't if i had taken care of better care of myself would i have been able to take better care of her and i know there wasn't anything i would've been able to do to prevent her death but what if i if i would i have been be able to make it easier on her if i would have taken care of myself and that's like one huge regret that i have oh i know i am <laughter> but xxx it's my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that i care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and i know other people i can't really direct them into my own vision because they're their own individual beings and they can't you know be what i want them to be and i know they're not going to be but i still have you know my ideals and i want the way i want everything to go and i want everybody that i care about to be happy and to be able too  fit into my life in a way in the best way possible but i know 'cause they're other beings and i know i'm not gonna be able to do that for them and they're not gonna be able to do that for me but it's still my ideals <laughter> so i have to sometimes have to look at it and go well is this what i want because i want it or what is what they want and what's their <thei> is it their decision or mine and it's usually it's theirs and i know it's theirs so i so if you really care about somebody you're just gonna support them and go with them but  it's still kinda hard <laughter> for for me and know i gotta get over it um ten or twenty years ago probably to have been more assertive in starting my own life because i wound taking care of my mother i mean she got sick literally the weekend i graduated from college <laughter> and i had a job lined up and i had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her and i think i would've been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside  the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about ten years so i think i i probably would've done that um but i tell myself just do that you keep who you are and learn to separate your you who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family to keep a sense of of yourself that's probably what i would've and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself that's probably the advance advice of what i would give myself    ten years ago <laughter> no no no but probably 'cause i haven't gone to a doctor about it <laughter> 'cause i don't wanna know and i mean it's not i know there've been times in my life where i've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it but i'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment and of it gets <ge> um after my mother had died i mean it'd been this long battle for a year that we lost and i didn't know if i if i was to blame for that it's like logically i knew i wasn't but how could i convince myself of that um two weeks after she died i wound up with pulmonary embolisms in one in each lung because i didn't take care of myself for a year and i figured oh i'm thirty years old if you know whatever i do to myself i can get over no <laughter> turns out no <laughter> but um i mean i wound up having to take more medication because of that uh it's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to get out of that depression 'cause so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden i didn't it's like the rug was pulled out my like bottom fell out of my world after that so that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression um i almost got divorced because of it because i just didn't want anything anymore  so and i was i being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point and i started getting very distant from him just pushing everything away just you know figuring well what am i gonna do with the rest of my life now and it it's been a fight you know you mean there times when no i couldn't get up just stay in bed and sleep all day you know but then realizing that when my mother died i had four cats to look after two are mine two are hers and so i wound up adopting the two that were hers i mean well they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you know own own supplies i took that responsibility of doing it for them so that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not i was gonna get up and provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go without taking care of myself but they couldn't they didn't you know so they eh they actually got me up and and made me go out and face things even though i didn't want to didn't just didn't just kinda wanted to curl up and die but that would've been my choice not theirs and they i mean what would happen to them if i wasn't there to take care of them they would've been you know sent to a shelter or whatever probably  and maybe they would've not been readopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for  for me i mean for me making selfish decisions   so it's like i need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed <laughter> so <s> and that's actually been a motivating factor is to to 'cause i've figured out that if it was just me i'd be able to live without a lot of stuff i mean i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it wouldn't be a big deal i wouldn't care   as long as i was doing what i wanted with my life but i have a family to look after now  so i have to go out and do things  you know i i have to go out and look for legitimate work you know day you know day job i have to you know   but i'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what i wanna do with my life but yet i have to take care of my family so i'm   been working on on a balance of the two very <laughter> but it's worth it i mean  it would be very i'd have a lot less things to worry about if i just lived in my car and said forget it <laughter>  but keeping a residence down paying bills things like that  it's it's difficult but you have to do it you know if you want you want anything <anyth> if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that  and i and and i know that  but  it it gets hard sometimes you do wanna give up  but then  it's like well what's the alternative  i mean i don't think i could live a comfortable life  'cause if i did i wouldn't do anything <laughter> i have to be slightly uncomfortable or i'm not gonna do anything with myself i'm just gonna  be content to just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with my cats or whatever  and i wouldn't get anything done  uh very  anxious and nervous and i mean what if  i don't find  enough you know enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if um  you know what what if i can't   keep a semblance of stability in my life and it it's actually hard work to be stable <laughter> and i know it's hard work to be stable but  what you know it's just eh a lot of what ifs  and and i don't think it's things that haven't happened and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened and i know that  but it still happens <ha> it still creeps in  so that's actually  a source of  anxiety  but then you try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it  but i i i know it it's a cycle and i'll go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do to saying okay what is the fundamental thing i need to take of here  i mean what <wha> what is just extraneous and what can <c> what can what is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue  and so  figure out how to figure things out that way and then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit but then something'll pop up and the what ifs will come up again  mm i'll have to  uh  figure it out again <laughter> but i know it's a cycle i know um what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it   you get over it pretty quickly you get through it  the last time i felt really happy i don't know zz um i  huh <laughter> that's a good question that actually <ac> that actually surprisingly stumped me  because i do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much sometimes just kinda eh in the middle um really like overjoyously happy i don't know  i i'm not i can't think of <o> of when that happened i don't know you don't know  perceptions of other people i mean  probably as somebody who  oddly enough somebody who is laid back and you know  handles things as they come but i don't see myself as that   at all and it's a it probably that i can think on my feet and i'm not afraid to  hussle my butt off and do whatever i have to to survive and get things done  um that  and i can do it creatively and i try to  strive for balance  probably  probably the best things about me <laughter>  that i'm doing basically what i want with my life which even though it's not all easy it's not  um you know i'm not financially well off or anything it's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives 'cause i have an aunt that i really don't talk to  who and the reason why i don't talk to her is because she's always miserable i mean she's got a career that she  it's more of a job that she fell into  'cause my older aunt uh loves animals but didn't wanna be a veterinarian so she became a dog groomer  and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time   but her hands <ha> you know she started getting arthritis in her hands and she had um the actually my cousin's father went and kinda stole all the money from her business so she lost her business   and she kinda she retired early 'cause between that and the arthritis she wound up retiring early  she employed my younger aunt who was still a dog groomer but she hates it   and it's like change your life if you hate your life so much change it  and the thing <thi> the thing i'm most proud of is  yeah i'm not as financially well off as she is but i'm doing what i want with my life you know i can  be creative i can have creative people around me people who i actually like to talk to around me  people i actually like in my life and  be happy with that  and i see a lot of people who aren't  and it it gives me a sense of of maybe a a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say i'm not like that  and i'm actually doing what i want even though there's sacrifices i'm still fundamentally doing what i want with my life now thank you <laughter> okay  thank you <laughter> goodbye
419,female,0,3,"I'm going to bring this doorbell over here  thank you  are you okay with this yes  I'm good thank you  I was born in Mexico City  yes  I'm about 34 years ago  yeah  I tried to go back once a year but I haven't been in about 3 years  I haven't had the time and I've traveled other places but I'm planning on going back probably next year  okay  how does it compare to LA  well I can't ever see myself moving back to Mexico City it's a huge huge City and I like La more there's more opportunities and I just feel at home here  my family moved here like I said I was very young and my parents moved to California to work and then we just stayed here  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer I love traveling I have not traveled as much as I would like to but I do love to travel  just seeing these things meeting people from other countries to stop feeling relaxed and having no worries because you're on vacation I just love being in other places  the last trip I took was a 7-Day cruise and it went to St Thomas Barbados St Lucia Dean Martin and it was amazing I would love to do that trip again  I think going to Mexico the last time I was there I went to the pyramids still see what's going on and I had not been there in many years and it just was amazing to see the pyramids and I can't even imagine how they were able to build such great structures  I consider myself more sigh  in social situations I kind of feel uncomfortable I'm not one to just go up to people and start conversations if people come up to me of course I'll talk to them but I feel slightly awkward just kind of out of place at a party  I actually studied history  I've always been interested in history and I just wanted to learn about histories from other cultures and of course US history so I'm very interested history  I'm actually working in the education field  what's your dream job  my dream job would actually be traveling around the world and having a show on like the Travel Channel that would be my dream job because I would get paid to travel and it's something I enjoy to do doing so I would love to do that as a job  I love reading and I love taking baths so to relax I like to take a bath and I read while I'm in the bath and I also like going to the gym that helps me deal with stress and it actually relaxes me even though I'm exercising  I used to be not very good at controlling it when I was a kid I would get mad very easily and sometimes as an adult I still get angry easily but I've gotten a lot better at trying to think about things first before saying them and not having outbursts things like that  the last time I argued with somebody was probably about a week ago it was my best friend and she actually she has kids lie down and for some reason she thought or thinks that I think I'm a better person than she is and because I went to school and she didn't and she's home with the kids and you know I'm able to do more things I don't think I've ever made her feel that I've been I definitely know I don't feel like I'm better than her but for some reason she accused me of that and we had an argument about it  tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle different  well that's situation I wish I had handled differently because when she was talking to me she was very upset and I started off pretty, I'm just trying to reason with her and let her know that I certainly didn't feel like I was better than her butt towards end of the conversation it just kind of turned into a yelling match between the two of us and I wish I had been able to just stay calm and maybe ask her to call me later when she calm down instead of just continuing the argument  I was angry at first but once we hung up I felt really bad about the situation I felt that maybe I could have just let her let out all her feelings and then try to speak to her calmly instead of yelling at her to  ever had  oh wow  that's a tough one I think  cuz I think one of the hardest decisions I've had to make is breaking up with a boyfriend of 7 years although I knew that it was the right thing to do I was kind of hanging on to the fact that we have been together for so many years and I kind of felt by ending the relationship I would have wasted those last 7 years of my life so is a pretty tough decision to make but I realize that it was the best decision for me at the time and I'm actually glad I did because then I went on to meet my husband  thank you  about me bag or something that you wish you could erase from me  well about I would say maybe  15 years ago I was hanging out with a couple of friends at a club and they met some guys and they invited us back to their place and I really didn't want to go because I didn't know these people and I mean I knew their names and that's about it but my friends really wanted to go and I wasn't the one driving so I decided to just go along with them and back at their house one of the guys actually pulled me into a room and try I got scared I yelled he tried to choke me and I thought I was going to die right there right there and I was going to kill me but likely one of my friends knocked on the door because she heard me scream and we left so it could have been a worse situation but I still think about it and wish that I could erase it from my mind  it was  we have a pretty good relationship I am close to him I have a sister and a brother my sister is two years younger and my brother is two years older and we got along pretty well my sister and I used to be best friends but then we grew apart and then and now we're actually closer I think than ever and I have a pretty good relationship with my parents my dad still treats me like I'm a little kid sometimes way to annoys me but I think we have a pretty good solid relationship  how easy is it  I usually wake up a few times throughout the night so I think it's rare for me to sleep the whole night through ever and I do feel a little like tired in the morning when I wake up it's hard I'm not a morning person definitely so yeah it's kind of hard to get a good night sleep  I don't know I have a hard time falling asleep and then sometimes I have bad dreams or I need to get up to use the restroom but yeah I don't remember the last time I actually slept the whole night without waking up at least once  emotionally good I'm actually on vacation right now from work so that's really nice physically I feel good I haven't been to the gym in a while so that kind of makes me feel bad cuz I like working out but health-wise I'm good  no  no  it was a lot this past weekend I actually went out of town with my husband we didn't go very far we went to Santa Barbara but we really enjoyed ourselves we went wine tasting and went to the beach and just had a really good time  how your best friend describe  she would probably describe me as a good caring person patient very shy to place a 2 that I have a hard time saying no to people when they ask me for favors cuz I'm always doing things for other people so yeah that's how I think she would describe me  I wish I was more outgoing I wish that  I what else definitely more outgoing so I could have more friends I don't have a large group of friends because I am very shy I also wish that I could have more patience than I do sometimes I'm very sorry to Paisans and I wish I could  find a better job so I could do more traveling  yes I actually took a really long time after high school to go back to school and get my degree and I really wish that I could have you know taking care of it a lot sooner than I did and I also regret spending seven years of my life with my ex-boyfriend  advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  I would have told myself to stay focused on school that going out and hanging out and just you know going to parties was not as important as I thought it was and that my education should always come first  I'm proud but after so many years of not being in school I was able to go to UCLA and get my degree yeah that would be my proudest achievement  okay  thank you  bye"

355,male,1,10,yes  alright  I was born in Los Angeles California  I want the weather and  the fact that the people aren't so obtrusive like on the East Coast  just the the traffic in the Smoky weather  I used to I'm unemployed now so I'm rarely go anywhere  I have a BS in business with a computer option  I thought that the only place I can get a job with a business degree was in accounting or in business computer message so I took that I took business computer math adoption  I probably be  professional sports player and actor something something that you enjoy doing  I like to ride my bike I like to watch sporting events now I can't afford to go to them so I pretty much watch on TV  I like to travel but like I said I don't have money for that anymore  that's all right  people who are chicken heads they getting their nose in other people's business even if they're just strangers expect that from a family member  where are friend but you know fishing with the internet that feeds a lot of that now we know what Orwell is referring to when he spoke the big brother in 1984  I don't do much him much different than I would otherwise  and I had many temper outbursts  girl you was my aunt  and it was because she was basically  making leading statements trying to trap me into saying something about a relative and if you don't know I'd me greatly  I'm kind of on the outs with my parents  the black sheep  I mean my Mom's done the most to help me she's done a lot you know more than anybody by far  well I mean she's just me one time when I was in like 15 I went with a friend of mine to see the Crosby Stills Nash and Young concert at the Forum and she has seven kids and she pick me up at the Sizzler is right across the street from the Forum at 11 at night and I couldn't imagine the others had to do that day that she agreed to do that but she did  oh probably  going down to the cape at the end of a Baja Peninsula and Cabo San Lucas or photograph in the bridal veil falls in Yosemite  I was by the two most majestic see sites I've ever seen  it was when I could afford to travel  no  no  I was diagnosed with depression after a hospital visit in April of 2011 and I took some Lexapro but I stopped after one day I didn't want to do it anymore  no  because I didn't feel it was help I feel I was becoming a zombie  yeah  depressed about not having a job for over two years I lost my job in October 2010 and except for you nose job like this which I'm fortunate to get just neon daily things focus groups like that I haven't worked  thank you  Ashley when you're 56 years old  well just get the general feeling of hopelessness  I get out of my bicycle out of walkthrough bikes 4 hours a day spent about 2 hours each  yeah it's good to me  very easy  cuz now I'm old when I was young I couldn't sleep more than 4 6 hours a night  cuz I'm Restless  are you triggered by something no  but now that I'm old I am I sleep much more easily  I pray before I go to sleep and that that's it that's when I can't have any trouble sleeping I just pray beside different prayers like the Lord's prayer Hail Mary stuff like that and I'm leaving to fall off to sleep  I don't know probably  you have any news Civic remembrances  I love that you know it was when I had money to spend I know that and when I had to have a job to have money to spend so it's probably 15 years ago  well  I haven't really enjoyed anything that last week I did a made $75 on that job with the the county basically it was an emergency preparedness exercise they were running for their personnel and the enlisted people to play  the basically the relatives of people who'd been in this fall bombing at the Staple Center and we you know ask question sign up unit on giving information on missing you no relatives and basically I was provided by the county and they said they went to a routine in downtown LA  that's not hard it was just a just a routine we had to follow we had to act like we were actually missing somebody and had to give this ethics of their characteristics height weight excetera  I don't have a best friend  I'm a very bright I'm a perfectionist at my job  I bet about it  I got a business degree and I'm never been a motivated person I went to school I went to  2 state colleges in two junior colleges to need that in so I believe that was probably the most significant contribution that I made to my  anatomiya I guess self-esteem you might say I had something to hang on the wall  yeah I regret you know alienating family members  I would have  basically not been so impetuous and left left jobs think thinking that you know I can always get another one and not you know basically blow-off jobs I could probably work at one of the employers that I used to work for now  Fade Out and locations but I burn Bridges there so that's not possible  thank you  hasta luego

was like okay well this is the problem and it i just wanted help because it just when your mind is after you like that's like it's just awful to have your mind taking control of you like that  yeah  yeah it's hard  um yeah yeah i definitely always thought i had a problem i always thought something was like really wrong um i just always like kinda nervous around people like i never can really like look anybody in the eye 'cause i'm just so nervous my eyes are always kind of like racing and i um would have sweats if i was in the situation um that reminded me of the situation like i just try to avoid what reminds me and brings those flashbacks yeah  oh um i i've been feeling good i've been getting out more every day i'm trying to um i guess walking keeps my mind off my p_t_s_d symptoms so i'm trying to walk more that helps  thanks um yeah i have depression um yeah  um it helps yeah it actually does help me a lot um i currently don't have one right now i'm actually getting a new one in a few days though like it's kind of a mix-up but yeah it really really helps me  um i noticed that i've had less flashbacks and um i've been more relaxed i guess and um yeah just you know trying to keep more occupied yeah it helps  um the last time i felt really happy um i guess um i don't know um today 'cause i mean i'm glad to be part of this <laughter>  um most proud of uh well <sigh> um i'm trying to think of what i'm most proud of um  i  think i'm most proud of like the fact that i am able to you know not be like well i mean most people i know they like deny that they have a problem and i'm proud that i can actually like you know be a person who can realize okay i have a problem and i need help but a lot of the people i know they don't take medication they're untreated and um they just don't wanna get any help and i'm glad to get help because i don't wanna feel that way and i wanna get help for the problem instead of doing that  oh gosh there's a lot i regret yeah there's a lot um i regret you know uh drug abuse you know but that's part of you know the p_t_s_d i regret um a lot uh mistakes you know relationships stuff like that  wow um i would've told myself to um i guess the advice i would've given myself was to  try to keep my mind more relaxed i guess yeah um well i'm a very nice person and i always like to smile people are always saying how i smile a lot but um the smile i guess it kind of hides like what's on the inside but you know i'm pretty depressed you know but i just try to keep smiling and i always like to lend a hand to help and make people feel better

392,female,0,1,hi I'm Ali thanks for coming in today are you okay with this yes  I'm doing well  California  I like the weather I like the people  I don't like the traffic that's primarily it  sociology  it's a topic that just really interested me the most out of all the other subjects  now  to be a writer  can you tell me about  I like being able to write what I want to write right now I write things that I'm not really that interested in  like what like articles about a teenager culture stuff like that  I think they have it pretty easy and I know how easy they have it  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot at no not really  okay  you can see yourself more shy  depends on the situation or who I'm around when I first meet people I can be shy but if it's someone I've known for a while I can be that guy  I'll lay down or try some shirt like deep breathing or just maybe do something that's kind of fun in my numbing like watch TV  I'm pretty good I don't really let anger show that much I'm not like that I don't have a fiery temper or anything like that I'm pretty rational  when was the  I actually can't remember when the last time I argued with someone was cuz it's been so long  what's something you feel guilty about  because I feel guilty about the fact that I don't talk to my grandparents as much as I should  I'm close with my grandparents but not really anyone else in my family  cuz they basically serve raised me and my parents weren't really in the picture that much  I can't really think of one  right now  I guess when my sister died it was really traumatizing  yeah yes  is the hardest decision I've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband  what made you decide to do that because we weren't getting along and there was no reason to stay married but I still felt like I should stick it out  how hard is that  I mean it was hard at the time but I made the right decision I think  my grandmother was a positive influence from a young age  can you tell me about that  she's just a very strong powerful through staunch character that rubbed off on me  so good  how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep not really super easy  I sort of I mean it's probably my fault I go to bed too late  just heard a foggy and distracted and trouble concentrating  okay  how did the feeling lately  you mean like my body  normal fine no complaints  and same as ever  no  last night I was just hanging out with my friends and was just having like a really good time sharing stories and laughing and stuff  how would your best friend describe  probably funny and easy to get along with but also caring  bunny radio  I spend my ideal weekend not really doing much like maybe just sitting around reading or going to the movies watching TV  is everything your  no I don't think there's that I don't think I think regretting things is a waste of time  advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  don't try to  don't go out of your way to try and press people if they like you than they like you  what are some things you wish you could change about your  sometimes  sometimes I can be kind of lazy  I'd like to have more of a laxative  better work ethic I guess  it just sort of putting off stuff until you know right when it's due or after its do things like that procrastinating  okay  tell me about a time when someone made  sometimes for the things that I write people will write negative things about me like in the comment section on a website that'll make me feel bad  I'm articulate and funny and a good friend  I guess I'm most proud of the fact that  I  and satisfied with myself and my friends and my status in the world  I'm proud of the fact that I feel comfortable with it  I'm just hanging out with my friends for people watching watching a movie that's good listening to music
487,female,0,0,<synch> yes i'm fine thank you detroit michigan yes i moved to l_a myself in two thousand and seven but my family came here many more years ago more like forty years ago uh i don't go back to detroit anymore i really don't like the weather and i really don't have any reason to most of my immediate family is out here in california and uh completely different um for me detroit was just very cold it it wasn't the best for my personality i prefer l_a more open space a warmer climate warmer people just a different different uh vibe that i that i like better after my husband and i relationship ended i had family out here so i thought it would be easier to start over here than some of the other places i had lived or to stay where we were at extremely easy i came out here every year to visit while i was in college so i was extremely used to it plus i had also taken um six months out of off of school and lived out here and went to school out here so i was completely used to it well like i said the weather is number one it's just uh less crowded it's more open space it's a a calmer friendlier vibe less rushed the smog would be one and when i drive the traffic in certain areas it can be but um in general there's not a lot that i don't like <l> it's like i guess the overall threat of earthquake but that's isn't really that much of a factor 'cause it rarely happens the price of real estate <laughter> that's another one that i don't necessarily like i can't see your shoes i can't see your shoes at all so i don't travel as much as i used to but i have traveled worldwide new experiences well i used to be an international flight attendant and then later i traveled through my work as a cruise line and as an international sales account executive so i've traveled a lot of different places and um i'll have to say they were all pretty much enjoyable 'cause you know there's different cultures different things to see do learn enjoy experience uh my experiences i would say in um europe visiting moreso i've also visited uh in south south america i guess 'cause the cultures are so very different i would probably say more shy um in general um compared to people who i know are really really outgoing although i've had them describe me as outgoing i like to read i like to walk or power walk or hike listen to music you know i'm very good at controlling my temper oh probably when i was married with my husband many years ago it it could be many things i don't even know in specific but just anything in general pretty much could turn into a debate slash argument with him it could be it could be a choice of uh some of the instances when i might've been with him and i you know got emotional or let it bother me that he made such a big deal of something rather than um just you know seen it as not something to respond to perhaps but it would always be we're we were also pushed to answer so you know you can't always just say ignore a person there 'cause many times it's just a matter of ignoring situation and it doesn't escalate but some people you know don't respond to the so-called norm if you ignore it mm uh they'll just you know de-escalate but that's not always the case i taught middle school kids and you can try calm um methods with them but that doesn't always work but you always have to as the teacher maintain you know your professional demeanor so you can't really um even when they you know the kids do something outrageous or possibly dangerous to themselves or other kids so well that could be several mm um i guess a decision in um along with my mom deciding to let a relative have surgery uh that you know the outcome was uncertain it could go either way and in that case she died so you know uh it's a pretty hard decision 'cause you don't know but you also know if you don't that it could be very serious outcome for them as well mhm <sigh> oh many different things that could occur you know in life you always are second guessing things that you might could do but they also can be learning experiences so is it necessarily a good thing to erase them you know if you can look at it as positive sometimes people can have a strong reaction and they don't really look past the uh impact of the event 'cause there might be something that you can gain from that but there are i i grew up in a home of dysfunction so there was just domestic abuse you know and um there were many incidences so you can't just say only one 'cause there is lots of traumatic things but it also would've been a different outcome in say learning to deal with some of the things that occur in life as an adult that sometimes i see among acquaintances or friends that have not had really strong experiences fall apart or just have very very difficult times dealing with so um you can listen you know you and i and i 'cause i understand that not everybody's had the same experience you know you can walk them through levels of understanding and you know as you know someone you have a balance of background information on which to help them pull from and to see that you know things will progress in a better way knowing that this isn't like the end of the world or as terrible as it seems that it could be and you can also relate other experiences to them of things that were worse or you know seem to be and of course there's always in general i mean when you look at all the calamities in the world you know most of those things aren't affecting us or the people that we know here so that provides us perspective that you know can pull someone out of their i won't necessarily say self-absorption but the seemingly intensity of their experience right at the moment well we have a a good relationship they eh for the most part there are different levels of um stress and trauma that some of my siblings have experienced so it has made them interact with life and people you know more intensely than others some have not had um as much experience in life that will help them deal with things you know in a different way so it's always evolving and i walk in positivity as a a lead of you know uh the way i respond to uh try and engender a more positive response from them rather than feed sometimes the um very strong reactions or responses or interactions that they may have pardon i didn't <di> i didn't hear you could you repeat hmm hmm my mother different teachers friends well my mother has always been a very calm um person for the most part easygoing even though she's experienced a lot of negativity i've had teachers that have um been very um positive <po> positive and proactive and have you know taught independent thinking and techniques to rise above some of the things that were occurring and just various friends that you know i would see handling situations sometimes more much more more difficult you know dealing with things so it depends for the most part it's you know pretty good um it depends if i'm dealing with a lot of things or studying or you know um trying to get more hours in the day 'cause i need to get things done then you know it's less but um in general i don't have a problem sleeping it's just if i make myself stay awake <aw> stay up because there's more stuff that i wanna get done i've been feeling okay uh less you know stressful in xxx it it goes in general 'cause i'm got several projects that i'm working on so um but in general good like i mean not in particular i mean i just seems um less stressful as i get more stuff done i just and the stress comes from sometimes there being a lot more things to do in a shorter period of time but you know reorganizing some of the things that need to be done you know can smoothe that out no i haven't but i know it's something that a lot of uh say veterans in particular have people have i have not no well there's several i guess um and happiness comes in small or large things but in general every day <d> every day every every moment to me is i mean <mea> i mean every day every morning is great wonderful you know day of happiness um as far as big celebratory kinds of things i don't have big highs and lows like that i think it's something that should be on your continuum you know in every day it can be a really great meal it could be a great view it could be you know a moment shared with someone you know so it should be an even on an even keel um as uh uh perseverant um you know i will continue forth and and um positive upbeat um maybe not doing things differently when i were younger like spending my money differently or or spending my time you know a little more differently but that's hard to say it's like okay as your get older you can see you know you could've done some things differently instead of buying the house that i did i would've you know waited and bought another one i mean things like that i would have um made myself move to california sooner and i'm i would have um instead of buying the house that i bought then if i'd know i would <ss> would have you know the situation i have now waited to get something different but you know how can you you know have that hindsight you make the best decision that you can at the time with the best information <in> information available you know after you have looked at several options of um being independent and educated able to uh take care of myself okay bye bye now
396,male,0,5,okay thank you  thanks for coming in today  created to talk to people and it stays  are you okay with  yes  okay  Virginia  I wanted to live somewhere different than Virginia with a little bit more of diversity  once a year maybe  add song it's a lot slower and there's a lot left to do there  I wanted to live somewhere different and a nicer warmer climate and somewhere where there's a lot more to do and I was a lot more going on  for me it was really easy cuz I wanted some it was very different and I wanted something different  I like I like all the things to do like the Museum's I like the beaches in the mountains and all the hiking and all the free things to do  people don't appreciate what they have here that just come here and want to take something but they don't want to give anything back in bad drivers  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot  not as much as I'd like to I travel whenever I can but usually can't afford to you that much  well I like taking I like taking pictures a lot and I just like exploring new places my wife and I like to see you  wildlife and Hiking monuments and to seeing different areas  well we  we've got we went to Central California we'd like to be able to go more internationally places but that takes a while to afford so we've gone more locally so we went to we went to Hearst Castle in the C the C the elephant seals and things like that  I guess  I guess our Palm Springs trip for our anniversary we did the who did the tram in the nice hotel on the jacuzzi and romantic dinner and it was a good time overall  guess somewhere in between  English and film  well I am  was told I needed to go to college in I haven't quite decided what to do yet so I just pick something I like to do for the time being  well wish I had not been pressured so I had more time to figure out what I wanted to I might have done something different like Physical Therapy but  are you still working or not  I know I've been teaching gymnastics which is something I used to do before  what made you decide to do that  I needed to not starve and it did it it didn't end up being as bad as I thought it would be so I went for it and ended up being kind of fun  dream job is to have money and not have to work for it  okay  how are you at controlling your temper  overall pretty gif  I don't remember what about but it probably would have been few weeks ago with my wife  all anyone that I've ever actually gotten upset and yelled always wish I wouldn't do that but sometimes when someone is not listening it drives me crazy  now if I just saying something over and over and they're just clearly not listening it makes me really upset  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to me  I don't know I I spent a lot of time on them but I don't I don't know what the hardest one is cuz it if I decide to go with something and you know it's usually for a good reason  what's something you feel guilty about  well I guess I feel guilty about moving to California in that I left my family and Virginia I mean I know I shouldn't but they always seem to miss me and even though they don't like living there you know I'm the one that moved away so it's like I abandoned them  well I mean I don't miss Virginia but I do miss them so I guess a little hard  I have a good relationship with my  with my wife with my in-laws with my mom dad and sister there's no problems everyone gets along well  very close  mean anything anything where someone gets hurt either physically or otherwise  depends on how much exercise I have get a lot of exercise is pretty easy if I don't it's not  kind of like right now just a little bit  swelling out of it but not really too different otherwise  how do you been feeling lately  I'm just kind of run-down cuz my um my mother-in-law's is dying and we just spent like 3 days in the hospital and we're going to go back after this so not a lot of time to sleep  just some  just us just slower and more tired and a little more out of it that's all  have you ever been tigers  no  now  usually just when I'm having having a fun day either on my own or with my wife that's it's pretty easy for me just getting outside and and and Hiking or exercising not hard for me  I'm not sure maybe I'm maybe like eccentric but in a good way hopefully  is there anything you regret  no  2  be careful with your to be careful with your job to make sure you could keep from being injured and two  I don't know just just your normal your normal kind of older kind of wisdom  can you tell me about that  not much just a really everyone realizes things when they get older they wish they had when they were younger  what are some things you wish you can change about yourself  I wish I could get rid of my back injury so I could get back into shape like I used to be at some the biggest thing right now  not much to say just hurt my back at work and I just like to get past it cuz it's you know holding me back from doing a lot of things that's all  smile like you used to do gymnastics and trampoline and used to be a lot more active or work out more and now I can only work out a little bit cuz it hurts too much  tell me how you spend your ideal weekend  probably like during that during the day going going on a hike or to a park with my wife and enjoying taking pictures and Wildlife and exercising and then at night you know if we watch a movie or go dancing or just something like that  is proud of them proud of moving here and then I came here without

318,male,0,3,all right  okay  oh actually before that one thing I almost forgot to do something that stinks  are you okay  yes  I'm all right  Los Angeles California  the lights big city it's always something going on  the traffic and that's it  business administration and business management  not that about something else I'm doing networking at the moment  to open up a big clothing line and just Supply the whole world with clothing  yeah  definitely  I'm all about myself it's all about me  not often but more times than not yeah  being lied to and I guess people think you're dumber than do anything with you are  try to get away from everything going to my own space  very well I'm great at controlling my temper  probably like 2 days ago it was probably just over some sports it wasn't a real argument  not a lot but I travel enough  just being able to get a change of pace see somebody knows he new faces new environment  let me see the last trip I had was Vegas you know how Vegas cuz it was pretty fun it's a lot of a lot of drinking and a lot of partying going on  I'm pretty open-minded I'm kind pretty much everybody I'm a pretty even-keel guy  it's all right it could be better  no  no ma'am  nope  no  lately it's been pretty tough I guess cuz I've been staying up so late but that's my fault  I don't know I guess I'm a night owl all of a sudden I'm turning into an hour  sluggish and tired all day if I don't sleep well all day I'm just laying around  no not too much  give  stay focused and listen to the adults  yeah  self-explanatory I could have just listen to parents are other adults I tried to steer you in the right way and you know you're being a stubborn kid at that at those ages so it's like why do what are you talkin about I miss my life I can do what I want I don't have to listen to you but now I see that with every telling me was correct  how would your best friend describe  hilarious  are you to your family pretty close  both my parents mother and father  recently did I do a New Year's Eve party I had thought I had the time of my life it was so fun  I'd love to hear all about  this New Year's Eve I went to a party at friend's house in Baldwin Hills area he had it at a pretty nice house it's a three-story house and it was like 350 people in there it was pretty fun but it was also not that fun because it was telling people and you couldn't really move so that was the only downfall of the size that I brought my new year in great with tons of friends and that's how supposed to be done  what are some things that usually put in  I'm generally in a good mood every day I mean waking up with me in a good mood I guess you can say that but I don't know how good a good meal  one of my most memorable experiences are probably when I was younger I was in Boy Scouts and we should go camping all the time and one year we went to Yellowstone or Yosemite one of those places and we had to work on a mountain biking merit badge and of course made from the city I'm like a mountain biking I can ride a mountain bike but once we got in the real mountains on got on real mountain bikes I gained a new respect for the mountain bikers it was pretty it was fun and pretty intense going downhill doing about 45 miles an hour and dirt on a bicycle was pretty intense and I was I'll never forget that  I don't know that's a tough one. What am I most proud of I don't know honestly
415,female,0,3,<synch> yes i'm good michigan two years ago um every three months it's more homey and country than fast-paced and stuff uh the i work in the entertainment business so i had to be out here it was pretty easy because i lived in new york first and if you can survive new york you can survive l_a the weather of course beaches uh the people are much ruder and mean than what i'm used to but i like l_a uh graphic design media arts um in high school i was ahead in all my classes and credits so i had to take a college course so while in high school i got a two year college degree doing it 'cause i was good at it yeah yeah but now i wanna go into something else um i'm in school actually i take online classes now for business management <laughter> i um a really one day i wanna own me and my sisters wanna own our own uh rental properties and like uh real estate company we own six houses now we bought with our college money and now we wanna eventually one day own our own homes and apartment complexes yeah meeting new people seeing different things that you've never seen before um different languages everything just seeing what the world has to offer oh okay um me and my sisters went to hawaii last year um i believe we went to hawaii <hawa> honolulu and to then hmm maui yeah and we met the people in hawaii and they were so nice if i could live there i would um everything was memorable but probably jet-skiing in honolulu was very fun yeah outgoing <laughter> <laughter> music music is much therapy for me um well my family is very musically inclined like my dad and my mom's family so music has always been like that thing no matter how i feel if i put music on it makes it much better i'm pretty good i used to box so it let out a lot of frustration so sometimes i do that too i go to the gym and i do like a kickboxing class but i don't i never escalated to the point where i like blurt out or no i can control it pretty much well i live with my sisters so i argue every day <laughter> but it was over clothes my sisters and clothes always clothes um my mother my father are pastors of a church i grew up with two sisters and a older brother who was a cop and we're pretty close i have a nephew we're pretty close like every day we see each other close and we don't all live in the same house but we're together every single day at some point when we lived in a when we lived in michigan my family eh is in michigan um when i cheat like right now i'm on a diet with my sisters but last night i snuck and got mcdonalds so i feel bad because they've been so sticking to it and i cheated but that's pretty much <laughter it <laughter> um hmm mm me and my when me and my a friend of mine got into it and we said things that weren't like we hit below the belt and we and we usually don't and we haven't spoken in like three months now and i know that it could've been prevented if we would've just sat down and talked to each other but it didn't make it that far so yeah um probably moving here moving to l_a because like i'm i'm really like close <clo> we're really close with our family like i skype with my mom and dad every day so it was hard to go from there to here and them taking care of everything to me and my sisters having to do it on our own it was much it was different oh my goodness uh my parents my brother my dad my mom my sisters my family <fam> i have a great family so my family definitely um i wanna say two years ago three years ago my brother was shot on duty and he almost lost his life but he didn't and for some reason as much as i try i don't tell them this 'cause i don't want them to be like i need to you know whatever i always think about it over and over again and i'll cry about it like it happened yesterday but it happened three years just the mere fact of almost losing him kinda yeah not easy i work as a personal assistant and administrative assistant for a casting agent so i'm on call for her whenever so i'm never i never get a good night's sleep ever i know <laughter> um a zombie <laughter> i'm pretty much you would never know 'cause when it's work i i'm professional so if i am tired they'd never know but i'm very annoyed and very grouchy when i haven't slept um <sigh> tired and i have crazy headaches but that's probably from not getting enough sleep and working too much but yeah very tired yeah definitely um i'm shorter with people like being in the industry i mean people don't really care it's all about self and when i first came here i had the i had the personality and attitude of family and love and nice and being here showed me that everybody's kinda out for self here even the like the other girls i work with so i've learned to like cut people off and be short with people when that's not really me but i just see that's how you have to be <laughter> no no um <sigh> last saturday i did a weigh-in and i lost seven pounds i was like excited so <laughter> that was the last time um care too much uh i think about others more than myself so she'd probably say i care too much i'm loving i'm the person that every friend i have confide in from best friend to just regular friend so yeah i'm the mom of my friends um no not no i don't regret anything hmm never take no for an answer um i wish i could well i don't know personally i wanna lose like twenty more pounds but uh just i don't know be a little more adventurous little more adventurous um <sigh> i don't think i've had a time baby feel bad no i can't no i don't think i have one it i'm sorry i don't think i <laughter> have one oh um well me and my sisters has just started with yoga and we already do the beach like every friday but yoga is like our new addiction so we do yoga and we probably go to like a spa or something that's an ideal <ide> yeah um my my job my career because i've gotten a pretty long way at twenty three the job i hold so i'm pretty pretty proud of that you're welcome bye
434,male,0,2,<synch> yes i am i'm doing very good today i'm originally from chicago illinois moved out here when i was three yes i never go back family issues it depends on what you're into if you're into um the fast life and hollywood it doesn't compare at all um if you're into the cold weather then you would rather be out there i i like the sun i'll my mom and my dad split up <laughter> it's okay i have no idea i was only three when i moved out here i like the sunshine i like the weather i like the balance of the weather we have in the spring winter fall and and and the summer i like the beaches i like hollywood i like that the lakers are here and and <laughter> i love um the people is it's a different variety i think l_a is a microcosm of the united states people from all over the world come to the united states and people from all over the country and all over the world they come to l_a for a better opportunity so that's what i like about l_a oh gang violence <laughter> no not really i've traveled one time to arizona and one time to stockton california and another time to barstow california but i don't do much traveling right now mainly because of finances i studied alcohol and drug counseling i just felt it in my i just felt it in my heart that that's what i was supposed to be doing with my life is helping people overcome their addictions so um that was a kinda easy choice i got some advice from people and i just went into it to do it just just to see what it was and i finished school and did a intership and got hired and so i believe that's what i'm supposed to be doing with my life i'm not working right now i actually moved away and i had to <deep breath> i was married and we had to move away we moved away because rent was cheaper so i actually had to give up that job um in order to make that move but since i came back down i've been filling out applications and sending resumes and trying to get interviews so i can get back into counseling well it can be it can be very difficult at times because um i have a felony uh and and so i can't work with the youth and i can't work with the elderly and but the regular dopes i can and then you have to be certified and i'm not certified yet you have to work a certain amount of hours in order to be certified before they even allow you to take the test you have to work a certain amount of hours so right now i'm just trying to get into um interns you know try to intern and show people what i can do as a counselor because everything about me is not seen on my resume and um yeah they just want people to be certified um not being certified um the experience and the fact that i have a felony makes it hard <laughter> my dream job is to open my own facility um or or as an author you know that depends <de> that depends on on on people mainly i mainly adapt my personality to the people that i'm around if people are perky then i'm gonna be perky if they're standoffish then i may seem shy but i'm not shy i'm just giving 'em their space and allowing them to decide when they wanna open up but if people open up right away then i open up right away <laughter> i i mainly listen to music or i watch youtube write poetry um or i just close my eyes and just lay down and pretend like i can sing which i can't so <laughter> that's and another thing i do is i eat ice cream <laughter> controlling my temper i'm very very good at it it depends on what it is i have to say that last time i lost my temper it was because i felt like somebody was um scaring my mother so i lost my temper but ninety nine times out of hundred i don't lose my temper don't like to raise my voice and i just like to be calm and cool and i like everybody to be comfortable i don't want anybody to be frightened or anything there's no reason for anybody to be frightened and for us to be angry and you know taking out our past frustrations out on people who had nothing to do with it i just believe that and and i believe um angry outbursts to be a link to um heart problems and high blood pressure so i definitely don't want that well i was just telling you about um it was it was my mother's husband and to tell you the truth um i could've handled that differently but when i seen the look in my mama's eyes of fear i just lost it and i snapped you know i told my mother uh like um i don't like this uh you need you need to take care of this because i'm don't know how long i can keep my composure as far as this 'cause i've been seeing this guy mistreat my mother mistreat my mother but that's her husband and so i kept my distance in their relationship but when i saw her having fear in her eyes that triggered a part of me um that i don't like very much because i know if i get angry i usually stay angry for a long time so i should've just left i should've just left and then went home and rested and got up in the next morning went to church but um yeah it we had a big time explosion and that created and that created a lot of damage for about six to nine months so yeah those six nine months i can't get back yes well my brother's in prison um i haven't seem him in twenty years he's been there twenty years my sister moved to chicago thirteen years ago i haven't seen her since then so i'm only close to my mother and um my son i haven't seen him in five years and i'm still looking for him and waiting for the day i see him again and how that's gonna turn out for me i've just you know i have small family and i have family in chicago but i don't mess around with that side of the family just just because um of what i seen and heard so i just don't want it to happen to me at all so i just keep my distance someone who's been a positive influence <inf> influence in my life i would say scrubbed_entry taught me how to get my temper under control and how to express my emotions without me <m>  me expressing my emotions being threatening to someone else and taught taught me how how to like monitor my emotions and monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are and when they're really strong that's when i just need to be quiet until that intense fizzling subsides and then i can speak rationally and not just emotionally um and of course um he's he was the one that encouraged <enc> told me that i should look into being a drug and alcohol counselor um he got twenty seven years clean and sober right now he used to live on skid row and he <h> the way he changed his life around and you know the way he approached me as a father was just something that i'll never forget feel guilty about my grandfather um passed away in two thousand four and at that time i was just getting out of prison um two thousand two i was just getting out of prison and he came to see me and he told me in so many words that he wasn't gonna be around for that much longer but i didn't get it 'cause i had a lot of drugs and alcohol in my life at the time and my life was crowded with things that i considered to be more important than that plus the fact i didn't understand him what he was saying but when he died i figured out that he was telling me that i should probably spend more time with him before it's time for him to go but i couldn't see it then and i feel i think about it all the time something i can erase from my memory huh would be the day my brother hit my mom i always replay that over and over and over and over in my mind and it's like that's one memory i just i can just go without replaying in my mind over and over and over and over and over again so yeah that day that memory right there i felt conflicting feelings because on one hand on one hand my brother was protecting me from getting beat and on the other hand he was hitting my mom so was kinda in the middle uh most nights i don't i go to sleep maybe three in the morning and i'm probably <prob> i'm more than likely up at seven in the morning so i don't get much sleep it it depends it depends on the environment i'm in um if i don't sleep well i'm going eventually i'm gonna be irritable but it doesn't happen right away it depends on my environment and who's around me if there are difficult people that's gonna be a challenge for me and um if people are easygoing no one will even know that i didn't get much sleep how i been feeling lately i just been feeling like that things are about to start going better for me um making some better decisions um taking advantage of the opportunities that come to me taking advantage of my talents taking advantage of meeting the right people that can um open the right doors for me so i'm very enthusiastic about that even if it doesn't happen i'll send out a million resumes i don't care if i get five interviews i'm i will never stop because i know know that being a counselor is my life mission and and um i'm also destined to be a writer and it's just a matter of time before my book is out there and people um know about me because i've had a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that and i have a lot to offer humanity so it's just a matter of time before um the that the public is exposed to what um i've been gathering my behavior i'm more mellow um i laugh more more humorous i let a lot of things go that i used to just let tick me off and anger me and things that i can't control like trying to control people or or or trying to make sure people don't betray me and mm you <y> you just can't control that i think i matured mentally and psychologically eh and the um acquisition of a sense of humor was a major major breakthrough for me so i know my thoughts have changed and with my thoughts changing my behavior has changed i still have to monitor it um my thoughts and my behavior i still have to monitor them but overall i'm you know um back then i just tolerated myself now i um actually like myself and um it will behoove <beh> behoove you to feel the same way no no i haven't no last time i felt happy was last night 'cause the lakers won the basketball game <laughter> yeah my best friend would describe me um he calls me the truth because i always tell the truth and people try to hide stuff and i always reveal it they can't hide it from me um i have a statement that says i see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it and i see stuff days and months before they start happening i i know human behavior when i see it and i sniff it out real well and it's just a gift that was given to me so he calls me the truth um because of how i interact with people and how people um have to come clean with me because when they look at me they know that i see through them like i said like a clear glass with nothing in it and yes that's why he calls me the truth <laughter> um i wish i would've never well obviously i wish i would've never went to prison um i wish that i could change well um my economic status my employment status and um my teeth that's like a problem area for me i did a lot of stupid things years ago and they caught up with me and i didn't take care of my teeth and now that i need to be um confident about myself as i can be you know it always comes up every now and then you know the thought like i wonder if they looking at my teeth i wonder if they're looking at my teeth i never get the sign <si> i never get the impression that they are but in the back of my mind there's these thoughts that says are they looking at my teeth so i would really change that and i would change my physical um size i think i would like to be at least thirty five pounds heavier but i'm working on it twenty years ago which would make me eighteen i would've at that time i was a big time um high school basketball player for fremont high school and i had colleges coming to see me and i would've given myself the opportunity was to stay away from the troublemakers because i didn't and i blew my opportunity to play college basketball for duke blue devils and who knows i could've been playing for the lakers last night but hey i'm most proud of the fact that you know what i'm most proud of my mom really really um she graduated from school she had a full-time job she had a full-time job um she would wake up at five in the morning go to work get off her job at three thirty go straight to the college leave the college at nine o'clock at night she does this five days a week and still had the strength to maintain um she was on the dean's list and the president's list so doing all of this you know when they say xxx that older people can't do things i i just think that dispels that rumor um and she recently got her um license as a evangelist in the church so i'm just real proud of that and um her life has been affecting people in a in a positive way so yeah my mom <laughter> okay thank you goodbye

377,female,1,16,"so when she's finished I'll just wait for a little more buttons not working I'm pleased  are you okay  yeah go ahead  okay  I grew up in Wisconsin and I lived in Colorado for a bit and then they lived overseas for a little while and then I move to California  I moved here at the end of June of last year so I guess it's been 8 months something like that  at the most probably twice a year  Well my own town is all of 5,000 people and there are a lot of cows and barns and Farms so the opposite of LA  good question I have always wanted to live in California so but I had to living in in the Central Coast  and I just have been coming down to La like once a month for different business and that working and personal development stuff so yeah things were changing in Santa Cruz for me that client I had who is really the main like Financial  Main Financial Source I had that relationship ended so I was totally free to move and I thought well I guess I'll give Ally a try and see what happens so  I give it a shot and here I am  no not at all very very big city  I lived in Dublin in Ireland was it which is also a big city but you know European cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy and  yeah so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging and  I'm not much of a world Explorer. I love to travel I love it I live in Ireland and I traveled by the Morocco and I was in Costa Rica on my spend some time in Mexico so yeah  I love meeting new people experiencing new cultures and like also not just seeing what's different but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go  I want to hear about one of your trips  sure well  I guess trying to think which is my favorite time of night there's amazing things about Morocco and Costa Rica both but Morocco's incredible it was like 12 days and we went to three different locations we went up in the atlas mountains are beautiful and  yeah it's a really really cool culture that was fun  my trip to Ireland I actually visited there which is why I decided to move there so my most memorable moment of that trip probably dozens but the first most memorable moment of that trip was being in a bison and leaving Dublin and going to sound to the countryside and seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is time is everyone is these pictures of Ireland or you know you see in films and it's green and Lush and gorgeous but you actually get there and experienced it it's like the pictures don't do it justice so incredible  I might have an undergrad degree in English and psychology and a psychology minor and I have a master's degree in women's studies  no I use my English in Psychology I work in marketing Communications so actually do sales so yeah the psychology definitely comes in to comes into play and so does my  I guess my undergrad degree in English but really like I took that on and and created something out of it because most people who get an English degree just teach and I I wasn't wanting to teach  what made you decide to do  too cuz I'm not clear on the question  okay  my job  wow  yeah my dream job is  being a  a motivational speaker and trainer and coach  I'm in traveling the world doing that and impacting people's lives and really contributing to people  my relationships pretty good actually I  I just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who would not she was sporadic I saw her sporadically growing up I lived my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and they had two kids together so I grew up and I consider them like the family I grew up with so but I got in communication with my biological mother  last May and we've been  clear things up and have been in communication since then  well not sure what you mean but if you're referring to being communication with my birth mother is very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and they do not just the future but in the present moment with her so yeah  I'm shy  time to relax I do a number of things I like to do yoga and I don't have the money for it right now I love to dance I love to read I love to go to the ocean and spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions that really retarded is my battery actually probably more than anything else  I like to be with friends I love arts and trying new restaurants  yeah all those things are  both relaxing and I guess they're relaxing in the sense that I feel connected to the people in my life and today experiences of my life so  yeah  how are you at controlling your temper  depends if I'm driving not very good but otherwise I'm pretty good at it  last night I argued with somebody probably would have to be  Ono is with the LA times that the newspaper delivery  yeah that was the last time  tell me about  yeah the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that I take care of it didn't show up and I didn't realize that it wasn't there until  I'm late I don't know afternoon I think early afternoon and then I called them and they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after 10:30 in the morning which is absurd to me when they made a mistake in the first place so I mean for service at and it would pay for it for every day so I'm yeah I was just really irritated and then I found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so amazing Ricky L E X I was angry with people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me I was pretty frustrated  Noel there quite a few of those  I think about 1  the other day I had a phone call  and I'm going to coaching program and  it was from one of the coaches in the program and she was explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls cuz we have one particular coach we work with and then she called to tell me that I was going to have another coaching call with  someone who's not my couch and that hasn't been explained to me it's part of the program so it's in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my God I have all these people I have to be accountable to and you know I have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just  so yeah I wasn't  I was an angry I was just I just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and I talked it out with her and we got through it but  yeah I could have  certainly just been okay with what for was being asked of me in the at that time and would have made the call go a lot smoother  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make  large decision while there's been a few  why is moving to Ireland was probably the hardest decision now it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was challenging  that was the hardest decision was the first time that I  moved away from my family I was 28 and I decided to I chose to move to Colorado and that's a pretty tough decision at that point my family had been within an hour's Drive of where I lived an hour hour-and-a-half and now they're going to be a 12-hour drive away or a plane right away so that was challenging  oh lots of things  I love Colorado Colorado is beautiful beautiful state and the weather is so much better than Wisconsin and at the time I was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor outdoor community in Colorado so they were a lot more people who were in my age group and or single that was another factor and we're interested in the things I was interested in so Colorado to seem like a really natural fit hell yeah and then I found a job that I liked the pay was atrocious but I found some work that was really rewarding and that all came together just move  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  I was totally unrelated question  relatively easily it just depends on like what time I go to sleep if I'm out and I don't get home until 11:30 then  and having to go to bed late and I wake up feeling tired like I feel today but generally I can sleep through the night I've had some pretty anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks but even so even when I wake up from those are five-star from those I still can fall back to sleep relatively easily  I'm sure they are I mean I'm in another transition state and moving out of  out of the house that I live in right now or take care of an elderly woman  yeah and I just I have to find  the financial means to support me in doing that and it's and she creates a lot of anxiety just didn't her state of being anxious exhausting and I'd really depressing  living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing I've ever done and I would never ever choose to do it again if I honestly if I knew what I was getting into I don't think I would have said yes to the situation  I feel trapped and helpless like this nothing I can  no way out of the situation that I'm in no matter what I do it doesn't get any better I did I don't know I'm not getting any kind of work that I want to do and my money's not working at all  so yeah I feel pretty crappy  I have in the past year  oh a long time I was 15 I think 14 so it was over 20 years ago  are you suicidal  you feel down  oh yeah I fell down  I don't actually now  well I originally stopped  with my therapist because we had completed I mean we had worked on what needed to be worked on and I was no longer depressed and and then I began therapy again later on think I wish it was in my early thirties and then I we ended that because I moved to Ireland so  yeah I'm in depending on the therapist and sitting on your intention like I I don't go into therapy thinking I'm going to be in this therapeutic relationship for the next 10 years I think that's ridiculous  I think you going to therapy to work on a specific problem and I have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board you can see things that you can't see and  we not work through that situation and come up with  a strategy for notches that not just in creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies and tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever  tell me about the last time you got  can I feel really happy  Zoe Sierra go  no that's not true it was when I  saw my biological mother which was last May  my best qualities  I'm very strong  very strong-willed  I  very supportive and loving and nurturing I'm easy to be around I'm intelligence  and  is there anything you regret  I don't think so  now  what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  don't take life too seriously  how ideal weekend, spend some time at the beach and spend some time with friends  either going out at night you know to a movie or just going out to  a club or bar somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together maybe go dancing after and Sundays I usually go to  and then I have brunch with friends and  may I go home and Sunday night and get ready for the next day so  I am most proud of  a few things that mean I've moved to places that I wanted to move to and so I've done things that have really spoken to me and if meant something been dear to my heart to actually  achieve those those  goals are those  yeah I've done things that I wanted to do like move to Ireland and move to California  okay"
439,female,0,1,<synch> yes i'm doing fine i'm from los angeles and born in los angeles yes uh you have a lot of places to go a lot of people to see a lot of things to do smog uh the environmental has changed over the years uh xxx i've been around since nineteen fifty two and i was born here in los angeles and i see such changes as far as environmental with the smog and mm basically that's about it i've been to several <s> uh several places in the united states yes uh trying different type of cuisines uh i like to go to museum like the historical i'm a historical buff i um just uh going somewhere different than uh where i've been here all my life uh let me start with uh well try boston i had never been to boston before and when i went um i was able to look at the historical uh the buildings and i went to um uh i saw um um eh the lake charles and the and the boats and stuff and it it was just it was a good experience and um there's another place i went to i took a ferry and it and i my mind went on blank on it um god i can't even think of it right now um but other than that uh new orleans i've been to new orleans i didn't go to the mardi gras it's just i don't like to go and it uh to mardi gras when they have a lot of people um i just went on a off season uh i enjoyed that and i've been to atlanta georgia and i have taken a cruise uh i've went to the caribbeans and i took the mexico cruise uh i my next cruise i'd like to go to is alaska because i want to be able to see uh certain areas that we haven't destroyed yet as far as the environmental um i'm outgoing as far as uh going places i don't have a problem um eating alone um i don't have a problem meeting people um i'm only shy in conversing back and forth to a stranger <laughter> oh i have a favorite thing uh i like to go on the internet and i like to do sweepstakes i'm a a person that loves to try to enter in a lot of contests and i've been very successful since i was a kid i've won a lot of sweepstakes and uh in the evening time uh i find like a hour of time and i just go online and just eh i'm so good at it i know just about exactly the right time to even enter 'em i usually try to enter 'em before midnight when everybody else is sleep so it's been successful for me um getting married and having my children <laughter> mm i have a twenty-seven-year-old son and i have a thirty-one-year-old son um both of 'em uh well one of 'em's married the other one's not and i just not too long ago became a grandmother so i have one grandson and uh my uh son he uh works for the county of los angeles as a conveyance <co> a property conveyance conveyance examiner and the other one is a computer engineer so and i've been married for thirty three years and um basically uh marriage pretty strong you know what if you build a foundation with your children and have a good relationship with them and talk to 'em and find out what's going on and tell 'em that you love them uh my son i've taught them all the time when they went out the door i love you and even today when they'll call me and hang up they say mom i love you you always have to give them that that um good feeling when they leave the door that you care and uh i i've never had to go to <t> to <t> eh to any jail to get 'em out um they've been pretty obedient i mean boys will be boys but um i never had any problem as far as uh them getting into any serious trouble and i'm very proud of that especially with boys i don't know how it would've been with a girls maybe a little different but <laughter> with boys i have to say they were pretty obedient and they respect the law uh the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you and um i've watched my son like i said i just a recent grandmother and i watch him how he handles his son and it's it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home on how to handle his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey i got a wife i have a son and it's my job to make sure that i keep a roof over their heads so it pays off and i i basically he treats her well um my mother was more stricter on me <laughter> uh my my my parents um for some unknown reason i i guess because i my sister and i we're the girls they they weren't strict on the boys but they were more strict on the girls so they didn't let us go to a lot of places and then my parents also they weren't type that liked to travel and i used to look at them and say no i'm not gonna be like them i'm gonna travel i'm not gonna just stay home i i mean i mean <me> there's nothing wrong with 'em because they found love at home <laughter> and did things at home but they never really traveled anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one and i used to try to talk her into get on a plane and go somewhere and she said oh i'm gonna go here i'm going to go there but she never did she died she never did do <d> do any travel so i've made up for her and uh i i want to do something different and that's to to travel more than and be more out there i was more of a social butterfly my mother was a not a social butterfly so i made up for it i think before i speak and then i am the type of person also to um i take on other people's feelings before i um blurt out the wrong thing i try to uh analyze the situation first before <bef> because sometimes you can put your <yo> open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you may not be able to get out of um <laughter> it's probably something about my husband did <laughter> oh he <h> i know what it was it's about uh well probably over some construction <cons> new construction that my husband is working on on our house uh we had a disagreement on that um men have their own way of doing things and um i had told him not to use a certain uh eh person to work on our house but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead and now he sees all the downfalls and he didn't listen and so i didn't say i told you so but i guess he can tell by my facial expression that uh he he'd have done wrong and i told him i said look you're losing money and it became one problem after another so now all the construction thing is up in the air right now 'cause he knows he has done wrong and uh but he doesn't wanna face the fact that well he knows it but he doesn't wanna really face the fact so he says look it's my project no it's our project so uh eh that that's one of the biggest arguments what we're having right now um that i can think of that's recent i felt that he <h> he <h> he didn't really listen to me and he more so looked at uh a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways 'cause i told him that um you need to do your research i'm the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i i i try to dot my i's and cross my t's but my husband he's not like that he's like oh i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money and he's a good friend of mine so i don't care i mean is he licensed he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he just jumps into it <laughter> which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because it was just wasted money that we could've saved 'cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again and it didn't make any sense um i retired early um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i'd been working since i was eighteen and i had like thirty one and a half years of service and what was so nice about it that only needed <n> needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i don't know if you're familiar with calpirg but um we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long um i didn't get the full percentage i should've stayed 'til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay um eh i i found myself going back doing a little part-time job because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis <laughter> so um i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should've kinda waited 'til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up and i don't i pay very little money so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive um let me see the hardest it's probably when my mom died 'cause uh i'm not used to anybody dying and my mother um died in ninety nine of uh non-hodgkin lymphoma and i i xxx putting her funeral together um my brother and sister we never we would never face anybody dying or putting a funeral together and all the responsibility <responsi> because i am the eldest it was put in me and i'm like oh my god what do i do xxx and so um i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy 'cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized and i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay 'cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff and unfortunately my mom <laughter> this is interesting she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with with accident she had a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything yeah it was it was but and now i can handle i i i um <laughter> this will sound weird but um since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children that my husband and i we got together and we wind up getting our insurance uh uh uh uh policy xxx not insurance policy but um what do you call the um barrel insurance we had that and it just we've had it for mm many many years so it's almost paid but xxx ten years it'll pay for everything um the plot and everything and uh another thing that i did i've even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird so my son make one phone call that's it i don't want them to go through what i went through and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on and um he said he don't want anybody to to have any problem uh people coming in and telling 'em what to do it's already written we did a living trust i mean it's nothing they can do but make one phone call and that's it i have no problem sleeping i sleep very <laughter> well pretty good um i've been a little tired but that's only because of physical condition um i have i found i have vitamin b deficiency and vitamin d xxx deficiency so it's more physical but not in the mental um exercise walk walking more so no not really no no i'm basically happily all the time i'm mm more so i'm making other people happy i get more phone calls of people want inspiration about things uh uh when they have projects they working on and i try to encourage them uh and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey i really appreciate your input um thanks and then they i'll i'll follow up on 'em and see how they're doing oh uh resource person i've been um described as a resource person from my supervisor to from my friends because i'm the type of person i research everything i get into just about i just don't  xxx dive into any situation i try to look up information uh some i know we have the technology here uh that you can get everything on the internet but also go back to the old school like like even finding this place i mean i did the map google but also i love the thomas brother i'm never gonna give up my thomas brothers map yellow pages you'd be surprised i don't give up my yellow pages so there's certain little things that i don't really let go i know we have technology but sometimes you know you'd be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff that even though technology gives <gi> you have it right at your finger but you can find things and and they say i'm more of a resource person and most people come to me just to to look up things and i get that that that spunk about it because i like to look for stuff and find it and that gives me satisfaction uh i wish i can uh um stop going up and down on my weight <laughter> i'll lose weight i'll go on this big diet before the summertime and and then by christmas time i'm i have a what they call a yo-yo weight problem and if i can stop binging and making food my friend um i think that's just a nervous disorder i just <ju> i like to eat and um but also i don't like to be overweight either 'cause i have plenty of beautiful clothes at home and i can't get 'em xxx on right now so i know i say if i'm gonna go on this binge and try to lose weight for the summertime so i can get into those some nice clothes so it's mm mostly uh not happy with my weight that's it yeah i'm sorry didn't hear you um no not really i regret <laughter> that i can't stay skinny <laughter> i can't lose i mean i can lose the weight but i i regret not being able to keep it i i fall back on putting the weight back on um let's see xxx ten or twenty years ago mm i would've saved a little bit more money before i retired <laughter> and uh xxx uh basically um putting away more money before i retire instead of retiring too early most proudest is of my life um meeting a lot of people that came in my life uh i got good friends i still have fifteen of the best friends that i went to elementary school and in very rare you could find anybody can walk around and say they have the same fifteen group of friends we were in a sorority together went to college together lived in the same neighborhood and matter of fact we just had um well all of us had our sixty year birthday and our our high school group we put together a sixty year birthday reunion and here all fifteen of us with exception of one we're all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so i think uh it's basically keeping the same friends i think eh we're gonna probably outlive each other <laughter> okay you're welcome bye bye
399,female,0,7,okay move this I'm gonna move this behind your arm if you don't hi I'm Ali thanks for coming in today  created to talk to people in the states  I'm not a saint  are you okay  yes  pretty good  as far as my parents Ethiopia  yes  the beaches warm weather  the diverse environment  traffic  well I'm currently in school I'm studying African studies  how did you decide  I've always been interested in African studies actually was wanted to help people and I figure that I can help them by trying to learn about it and going back to Africa making influence  kind of in-between I have my shy moments but then when I'm around a group of people that Angela I'm pretty outgoing  hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the  interacts I normally write or I go to the beach and just sit there and play My Guitar  pretty good I don't really  get angry or anything like that I tend to keep it in or try to release it by writing  when was the  I actually can't remember the last time I argue with someone  okay  what's something you feel guilty about  all the people I've hurt in the past  can you tell me about  well I've  like cheated on people  hurt their feelings intentionally  some things I should have done that I regret now  well with my ex I could have ended it better so we could be on better terms now and I probably shouldn't have argue so much as try to instigate so many things I probably should have just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out  hardest decision I've ever had to make was  man I really don't know actually  having to see my dad go through surgery and see him suffer  well he had a tumor that had to get removed so it's just hard seeing him have to be in the bed and just be in the hospital when he really don't want to be there cuz he's a really live person and he'd rather be running around and stuff like that but just saying I'm stuck in bed and was just terrible  tell me about your relationship with your  me and my family are very close we don't I mean they've always been there for me and I appreciate it but we've never had that closed collection connection especially since they're foreign so they don't really understand where I'm trying to come from having been grown up out in America so it's pretty different when it comes to a racial mean the cultural boundaries that we kind of Step each other each other's feet on but aside from that we have a decent relationship when we do speak to each other it does it kind of awkward but it's okay  I think they are out of control I think that they're learning things that they shouldn't know at this age I think that they're doing things they shouldn't be doing and I don't feel like enough people are telling them that they shouldn't be doing it I feel like they're being applauded by the media there being applauded by celebrities that they follow  and there's not enough being done about it and they're just getting lost  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep depends on the night some nights it's pretty hard some nights I fall asleep like a baby  what are you like when you don't say  usually creative actually when I can't sleep I'll just stay up and I'll write something or read a book and ideas will pop up  stuff like that is usually a good thing when I can't sleeps nothing really bad cuz I'm having bad thoughts or anything like that  I'm lately between a mix of good and bad I have my happy moments where I'm at a Giants and I'm alive and then some some days where I'm just you know just sitting there just mellow thinking  not like my life self  I don't know his wife's been like that weighs have those UPS in those downs but they kind of balance each other out  no  the last time I felt really happy was  today  I'm just from the moment I woke up it was a beautiful sunny day  I went to see you some friends we had a good time went to school had some good grades on some papers wrote A good essay so pretty accomplished and I feel like my days just a good day  my best friend would describe me as odd most people would describe me as odd  I see a lot of odd things I do odd things I'm interested in things that most people aren't  Just Like Old literature revolutionary stuff  stuff about changing the world but through underground means  no I don't I don't live a life of regret  I never let fear stop you from doing anything  tell me how you spend your ideal weekend  I'm reading just hang out with some friends driving around finding something to do just go on an adventure  things you wish you could change about your  I don't wish I could change anything about myself I just wish I could build myself into the person that I'm truly supposed to be  tell me about a time when someone made me feel really bad  this one time me and my best friend got into an argument and she pointed out all the things I've done that I shouldn't have done all at one time how I've hurt people have hurt her the ways I've done them that were brutal and it just made me feel bad once I reflected on it all  my parents  can you tell me about  I mean although we don't see eye-to-eye the always bring me to this realization that I need at the end of the day although I never listen to him or I don't choose to listen to him once it happens I learned from it and I'm like oh that's what my parents told me so I learned to trust them more and I learn to understand that they are wiser than me and that they do no more than me  I'm not so much anymore I travel around the LA try to find you sights to see but as far as I don't travel outside  I'm discovering new things discovering things you never knew were there or the Limitless possibilities  I discovered I like I enjoy discovering new people new cultures  new things that go against what's normal for us and for myself  a few days ago I just drove out to the middle of the desert and I just sat there and I just enjoyed all that the desert has to offer and it was just enjoyable  I felt free away from all this the city's needs buildings and it just felt nice to be out in the middle of nowhere at a completely random time  feel good  I'm most proud that I've always been different that despite how many people have told me that I'm really weird rum otter I think weird things I've always maintained my original mentality  sharing your thoughts with me  all right
617,male,1,12,wow  okay  I broke it  not so good  okay  all right questions and then when she's done she should say goodbye and you can press this button  okay  okay  should be how good  yes  I'm doing pretty good  originally I was born in Denver Colorado  I like the beach sunshine  pretty girls  the ocean  other things  smog  excess amount of people in traffic that can be dealt with  I would like to travel more  seeing new things and and learning perhaps if you culture or something  oh okay I when I was younger I went to Europe and just did the backpacking thing  backpack around Europe for a little while and it was it was real fun  I'm probably just being in the military with some friends and stuff like that  why have a degree in film and I'm finishing a degree in or for business as well  now I look for work I'm trying to do some sort of entrepreneurial effort now as I finish my business degree  it'd probably be to own my own company that's kind of why I want some sort of entrepreneurial effort to push push for with some sort of interesting product or service that I'd be working in  I would say middle of the road a little bit shy and at times can be takes a while to warm up  are you cautious to meet someone new and then from there  I kind of see where to go from there I guess  my family they still live in Colorado their interesting people and good as well as I talk to him  pray couple times a week they're good people I have one brother and he has a couple of kids and that he's married as well  that's a good question lately I've been trying to get a daily amount of exercise like jogging or riding a bike and recently got a bike  something like that on a daily  effort  for the most part pretty good I try to if I have an outburst or if I'm being irritable I try to stay away from people who didn't like to go off on people they didn't do anything wrong  Edward change the topic in my mind I guess  what gets me in trouble would be more I avoid things and it kind of builds up and becomes worse  and that kind of gets the trouble and  basically just in a relationship with a girlfriend  to be honest with that it remember exactly what it was about it's just probably in one of us is being irritable and me and  going from there or it's probably a lot to do with the money as well I don't have the best financial security at this point  that's a good question  oh my I guess I I do Harbor a little bit of guilt from the military as far as getting out and people are still in I suppose I know that's it's not for me anymore  only thing well I I used to work at for a friend and I invested into his company  and the economy went down was a construction accessory company basically and kind of movement down and we lost most of our money like most of the folks around America and that pretty much  it was a good and bad thing is you got to look at it from a good good perspective but it definitely put it myself into talespin I financially and couldn't really do anything about it almost was homeless for a little while  but I I wish I wouldn't have invested into the company and just move forward and  perhaps going to school like I'm going anyway  I have  I was 21  I wanted a change in life I wanted some more real-world experiences  answer my country and also the added benefits of going to school or nice I didn't have  much Financial capabilities at that time and I wanted to change to get out of my current situation and that was the best way out I thought  are you happy  yeah yeah I'm very happy I join the military I appreciate it now more that I mount and understanding kind of what I supposed war was about it is definitely changing people and myself as well  yeah I did a tour both in Iraq and Afghanistan as well  see I thought at first it was very easy and then I came to understand he was very difficult  just because I was adjusting from military life and still having that in my head and not until now I realize that I probably just a few months ago  to Reno reintegrate myself a little bit better and choose civilian life which it's it's actually it's actually pretty difficult  no problem  movie think I when I got out of the military  versus I'd I invested like I said into my friend's company and we started that little business we're doing well for the while working and then lost all of our money  and then I traveled for a while at a gender stand now is obviously some other issues but I traveled all over America good working and went to school in New York for a little while  lived in a few different states and came back to California where I'm finishing school finally  living the dream  that's a good question I would say  well it didn't and instills you with with very good I think since of  sense of character and strength and you know I think there's a lot of good qualities that the military are military puts a new people but at the same time it puts a lot of bad qualities  as well because you need some sort of edge or something that you need on on am almost daily basis and if you don't get that then in a lot of guys do you know turn into drinking or drugs just cuz you can't get that same Edge  and that really that can really either hurt or benefit you  I've been feeling okay I've had a bit of a sinus issues lately but I've been feeling okay  actually I have my my thoughts I used to really have scattered thoughts  and  I would say I'm starting to get a little bit better Clarity which is good  taking a lot of different therapy and stuff like that and it it's actually helped  it's it's very as I can't really let the tough part for me is the schedule because that's if I'm not tired you don't sleep you just lay there  it's Hit or Miss really some nights I can sleep pretty well some nights I have to wait till I'm exhausted  and I don't like doing pills  pills are bad I didn't understand that but it's basically just can't sleep because either you're on my mind is always thinking about something or something I feel that I have to do but yet I'm not doing anything that's not true trying to always do something or do you have some some troubling dreams at times but that doesn't really negate me from sleeping and wakes me up is what it does because it can't be that the dream that you remember versus the one that you don't  when I don't sleep well  perhaps your ability and anxiety definitely go up I I definitely get I have a tendency to get a lot of headaches  and not sleeping very well definitely puts that into the mix  I have  not that I know of no  I I don't know I try to feel happiness on a daily basis I guess what you could answer but I'm not certain  I'll say my my dad's been a very positive influence  that's a good question charismatic her funguy pretty tough  a good worker  I'd say I really enjoyed jogging  the other day on the beach  something that I am most proud of I would say I'm actually an online Minister as well and I married my brother and his wife and that was a pretty proud experience  all good  she said goodbye  okay
365,male,1,12,<synch> sure i'm doing alright new jersey yes three months ago not very often uh it's much different uh i don't know it's just <laughter> it's a lot more crowded here to start a new life for myself it wasn't very easy at all <sigh> uh it was uh it was quite rough at first but you know i'm still trying to get used to life here i've met some good friends here um you know i love the hollywood area um and just you know the mountains are beautiful that's kinda things i love hmm the traffic not really no i don't just haven't had the time or the finances to digital media well i've always loved you know <deep breath> computers and you know designing things and uh i don't know i just kinda fell into it no i dropped out well i i guess my dream job would be working <deep breath> in something that uh i went to school for you know i i never really completed my education um but i guess it'd be great if i went you know back to school and you know finished you know my degree in digital media and uh you know finished and uh started working you know doing something in that field a little bit of both you know i i can be shy at times but i like to push myself to be outgoing you know it's kind of a a struggle for me but i i don't wanna be you know in a shell so i kinda force myself to be outgoing listen to music i uh sometimes just drive and um you know play music in my car and that helps me relax or i smoke a cigarette oh like what ooh um <laughter> just heavy metal that's all i listen to is metal well <sigh> it depends on how high my stress level is and how angry i am but i i do my best to not get so pissed off <laughter> scrubbed_entry and i don't know she um she wanted me to to come and pick her up uh she was a little drunk and uh we just kinda fought over the phone all over some other things and i just ended not picking her up because of her attitude on the phone with me <laughter> yeah it does something i feel guilty about is uh not talking to my kids uh often or as often as i should i've just been so busy with trying to get myself all situated here that i i don't really have time to you know talk to my kids as much as i'd like to you have no idea um it's it comes natural but it's no way easy and uh it's it's the hardest job that i love to do but right now it's extremely difficult for me because they live so far away and i i made this choice to come out here to l_a and i feel bad that i don't see them you know but the reason i came out here was to better myself so i can provide for them fear you know fear <f> just fear will you know you <y> you fear what's gonna happen to your kids you fear that something awful is gonna happen and not seeing them it brings about that fear a lot more you know and i can't i can't always be there with them i can't see them you know it it wasn't as bad when i was living in florida um and i i at least i used to see them it wasn't very often but i used to used to see them now i don't see them at all and that's the that's the hardest thing i've had to do as a parent is to step away from my kids if only temporarily i don't know how long i'm gonna be here for i don't know what my future holds but the hardest thing is being so far away from them just the the joy that they bring to me i mean i could be having a bad day and they just cheer me right up i mean i eh it sucks being away from them for for so long and they're so far away and just not seeing their faces that's it's it's the worst thing ever you know but i i love to just see their faces they they just bring a smile to my face and um i don't know well um i think the fact that i can get down to their level um i'm i'm a bit goofier <laughter> as a father than my dad was with me my dad was you know strict all the time sure he used to you know laugh and play with us but you know he was always very reserved you know and he kinda held back a lot he a lot of his emotions just because you know he was a he was a strong very tough guy um but with me i i i'm very goofy and silly with my kids and i'm strict when i have to be but i always love to you know play around with them as much as possible you know not i don't want them to grow up too fast and that that may have been yeah well <sigh> a situation that i wish i would've handled differently there's so many <laughter> uh i guess when i was still with my ex-wife in florida i wish i wouldn't have gotten so angry or i wish i wouldn't have let her get the best of my emotions she had a tendency to get underneath my skin and uh you know keep picking at me until i exploded and i allowed her to do that you know i i should've just walked away when i could and um you know not let my temper get the best of me no no no uh sometimes it's hard um sometimes i just lay awake in bed <sigh> you know thinking all the things that are going through my head all the you know all the stress that i'm going through with work and you know making sure you know wondering if i'm gonna if i'm gonna be able to make you know rent you know wondering what my kids are going through you know when i'll see them again if they even care about me anymore if they even know they have a father you know those are some of the things that run through my head and and that keeps me up at night sometimes a little <sigh> but <sigh> you know i put myself in this situation so you know i i gotta bear with it you know i gotta you know you reap what you sow so i <sigh> i gotta deal with it in my own way lately um i've been trying to not think so much about you know all that's going into my life uh i try to distract myself and that kind of gets me in a better mood you know if i'm hanging out with friends or just watch a little t_v something to get my mind off you know all the stresses in my life um the last time i felt really happy uh was actually a couple of nights ago i went out drinking with um with a couple of my friends from work and um i don't know we just got pretty drunk and just <laughter> that kinda helped me to forget all the crap that was previously going through my head so if if i can distract myself if i can forget about all that other stuff then i'm happy <sigh> some of my best qualities i guess that i'm convincing <laughter> um uh i'm kind of like a i guess you would say a counselor to some people you know some of my close friends you know i may talk people into doing things that they may regret or i may i mean i'm sorry take talk people out of things that they you know may end up regretting or i may um you know just listen to people so you know eh i could say that you know i definitely you know listen to my friends and help them out in their time of need when they're going through something troubling times like like i'm going through scrubbed_entry uh who lives in florida you know i talk to him every now and then and he's been having troubles with his girlfriend and you know i just kind of talk to him about his problems and listen i mostly <mo> i mainly listen because you know i don't think he has anybody else to listen to you know when i was living in florida i was uh very close with him so you know he he'd always relied on me and now that i'm here in l_a i don't wanna lose that you know connection with him because i mean i've always been there for him so he um he relies on me to listen to his problems and give him some advice you know about what i think you know he should do um so i think <th> i think he appreciates that and i and i'm glad that he you know relies on me for that uh he trusts me enough to tell me all that stuff <laughter> i don't know <sigh> um sometimes i wish i wasn't so kind or generous it seems bad but sometimes i i don't know people may take advantage of me and i may not realize it and um i don't like saying no to people i like to always please people so if i can change that maybe i wish i wasn't such a people pleaser sometimes financially in trouble <laughter> <deep breath> sometimes i you know it you know help others and not you know that may make me broke sometimes yeah i may not have enough to pay bills but i feel better helping people i don't know i regret not breaking up with my ex-wife sooner i regret <re> i regret <re> because she put me through so much crap in my life and um i was always trying to be a people pleaser i was trying to please her you know trying to please my kids as much as i can by not breaking up you know the family but you know there's only so much one person can take and i i think probably if i would've left sooner i may have been happier and things may not have gotten so out of control out of hand like they did you know during all those years with her so maybe if i would've got out sooner i don't know i would've been happier i guess um it's okay to be selfish it's okay to you know think about yourself sometimes you know if you keep putting everyone ahead of you then you're not thinking about yourself you're not thinking about what makes you happy and even though pleasing people may make you happy uh you have to think about yourself sometimes too and about your needs because you know you play an important role in the lives of your close family members and um in order to keep everything afloat you sometimes gotta xxx gotta worry about the one person that's you know juggling everything and holding everything up which is yourself so be a little selfish sometimes it's okay <laughter> i don't even know what a weekend is anymore my ideal weekend would be locked away alone in my room watching movies listening to music just with my cell phone off and not you know being with anybody or it could be out at a bar you know or you know watching a a metal show so i like to be alone but at times i i do wanna be out with uh with others i like you know being around people crazy <laughter> he thinks i'm uh i'm crazy for coming out here but i guess he would say that i'm dedicated and that i'm strong-minded and that you know whatever i set my mind to i can do it you know no matter how hard it is i'm not gonna wimp out so i mean i i really respect him for giving me his insight but uh i guess yeah i guess he would say that i'm crazy but strong-minded <laughter> my kids <sigh> you know that's the one thing that brings joy to me you know like real real joy are my kids and you know just having them in my life is is the proudest thing i can ever accomplish is just you know having them in my life and although i don't get to see them as much even <e> even when i think about them just thinking about you know how far they've gone you know what what they've accomplished in their you know in in their short time i mean eh yeah it makes me happy and i can't wait to see them again one of my most memorable experiences i guess that would be scrubbed_entry in florida you know going to see our uh you know our favorite band skeleton witch it was it was a great night overall you know one of the night's i'll never forget just because we'd been looking forward to it for you know so many months and you know when it finally happened it was surreal um it was it was a great night after all and overall sure you're welcome bye
321,female,1,20,okay my arms  chat with you  and then she'll let you know when you guys are done  okay alright then  yeah  I'm okay  I'm Chicago Illinois  at my husband's work was here  + 84  it was not easy for me it took about three years  I'm just a move I moved away from my family so I was uncomfortable I didn't know anyone here and even though I did make friends I just felt out of place  not as often as I would like I used to go back at least once a year but in the last few years that's diminish so I would say like every 3 years  the weather  I love the weather the beach you know as I've been here as long as I have the people have some nice people here  of the people some of the people yeah also I would say the economy  it's very difficult to make it here in Los Angeles  business in computer graphics  I'm not working in it right now  I'm working in retail  I just couldn't find work and so I had to settle for doing that for right now  it's very tough  I would like to be a human resource representative  no  I like to talk to people too much and when I understand right I know a lot about a subject I can go on and on about it and I'm interested in finding out about people if I'm sitting next to somebody else strike up a conversation with them just to find out who they are and  just so you know I'd like to talk to people I enjoy it  I'm quiet  rude people people that harm children in the elderly that makes me very angry War  I control my temper I don't have a problem with that I just get quiet when I feel angry and I try to think before I act  the last time we argued with someone was about a month ago and it was with my daughter and I was arguing with her over her therapy and she has cancer and dumb she wasn't telling me enough she wasn't giving me enough information and so that made me very angry I was frustrated and angry  yeah it was very hard  no  watching your children fail when they're trying hard or seeing that they can hurt themselves and trying to prepare them for that when they won't listen to your advice. I feel like sometimes they need to trust me more  the love of my children  when I was stop playing with my granddaughter and there was about a month ago  very excited and happy and just all my cares were gone I wasn't thinking about anything except for having fun with her so it was a good time  yeah it's the best  no  yes  it was over 5 years ago  I couldn't function I couldn't drive I couldn't sleep I couldn't eat at my I couldn't do anything I was completely  shut down I felt like I felt like I was looking out a window and in life was going on outside that window and I was just stuck behind the glass III couldn't participate  I knew something wasn't right  but I  lately I've been feeling depressed  I haven't had a good night sleep in a year I would say my regular pattern is to maybe sleep in an hour up to 3 hour intervals and they just keep waking up but I never quite get into a deep sleep  groggy and I have no energy  it's very hard because it's so difficult to work it's difficult to concentrate I make mistakes and I forget a lot  yes I do  yes  no I'm not in therapy right now  I could not afford to continue  I'm sorry what  I'm not sure  yes  I I feel more relaxed and  I I feel like some of my worries are lifted from me I have a I can think clearer because I am using the tools that I've learned through therapy  my children  I don't know  friendly  I think it's just horrible  I feel that the children are so neglected today and it's not the fault of the parents I think that dumb I think that we as a society we forgot that it takes a village to raise a child and nobody wants to pitch in no one wants to help anymore no one's helping their neighbor and it's very sad  I don't know  I'm eating dinner with my family  I regret not spending enough time on my education  I had children very young  so I needed to yeah I needed to take care of them  I'm sure I could have  to seek help  my grandparents  I'm just they introduced me to church and just you know letting me play at their home and play in their Garden it just showed me a lot of love and and I felt like I was cared for  no  not listening to music watching funny program on TV  going to school working  go to dinner with a friend  over a year ago  my friend  do work  very close  you're welcome  bye  okay

other people and learning about their environment and their cultures sure um the last trip i've taken outside of here was to italy and um that was my second time being there and i enjoyed it more this time because um i knew what i wanted to see when i came back and um and i was better prepared for italians and their culture i felt i wasn't as uh you know i was just better prepared i thought for that trip um <clears throat> that would be um being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house in the midst of acres and acres and acres of grapes was just magnificent um human development um <clears throat> i actually didn't decide at first to do that i started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant and um i went to a program in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant and through the process i learned that um i had to do a long internship without pay and at the time <t> and i miss i had a family so i had to make a different <diff> a career choice quickly and um so the college offered human development as a major and i um just went right in and used my used <u> used my units that i had already acquired towards that particular major and and i'm happy with it um currently no i stay at home i have a little one uh well he's not so little i'm preparing to go back to work um in the meantime i design jewelry well

unconditional all the stages that they go through they're stages all the time for every age <laughter> and then everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages so um i think i'm probably more in tune with those different stages that's why it makes me crazy um and i think that my parents the time that my parents were parents it was just kinda like you know is she fed is she dressed she has a house i mean a roof over her head and we're doing great as parents and we love her and so it wasn't um there wasn't too much i felt that that parents thought about in terms of that in terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there's books for every age every year month you know <clears throat> and um so i think it difference differs in that way tremendously very close <clears throat> outgoing mm i don't i don't um feel uninhibited <u> uninhibited i feel a little you know confident to talk to people i probably talk more than i need to <laughter> um <clears throat> i bead i <clears throat> do i design jewelry that's what i do to relax i'm pretty good i i well i think i um try not to not to um feel or let others know what my emotions are when i'm upset um which is not good 'cause if i don't do anything with them then i know that at some point it's gonna come out and um yeah that that's uh something i have to work on like exercising or something um <clears throat> it was my husband and it was about um he asked me whether i thought about cheating ever in our marriage on him uh really tired of talking about that same topic um well it came it spawned from <f> from a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for many things and um <clears throat> and so he took that information and came home and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me think about cheating and he knows that i've been resentful of him and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating <clears throat> and um <sigh> i we've had this conversation a lot of times and uh i mean not just that but i don't know just about cheating in general and um so i just said what i normally said normally say is that i haven't um cheated and that i did think about that when we were first together and uh but it was just a mere thought and um and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another and that just kinda <sigh> i guess irritated me i was really bothered by that and i just started thinking you know we're having this conversation yet again and why are we having this conversation <laughter> are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that that went into that um argument i mean it wasn't ayelling <y> yelling i mean it was part conversation and part texting um <sigh> not talking at all <laughter> um <sigh> mm pretty much any situation that involves my children and if i've yelled because i really don't like if i came to the point where i've had more of yelled it bothers me because um i was yelled at a lot and i just feel bad about that and i try really hard to not handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset i might get and result in in yelling hmm that would probably be whether to keep a pregnancy or not yeah yeah i um i was just talking about it yesterday actually and um oh i was pregnant and i had wanted i wasn't married yet and i had wanted to be married and but i just didn't think that i it was the right time for me and um i had pretty much made up my mind that i was not going to keep that pregnancy but i made the decision by myself and when my partner found uh discovered that i was pregnant he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me and so that decision was quite hard because i felt obligated to do so and felt super guilty to not and <drops microphone> oops and uh this is on correctly um hang on this ear piece is falling there we go that was probably the hardest decision actually you know what no i wouldn't say that's the hardest decision i ever had to make i'm sorry the hardest decision that i had to make in my life was whether or not <clears throat> um the hospital should um unplug the life or um life support machine for my father or not that was the hardest decision um because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that and to have been um to resort to the situation that he was in not capable of doing anything at all either speaking for himself um was beyond it who he was and i just couldn't see him like that anymore and he would be a vegetable i was told so i agreed to um resort that not hardly ever <laughter> too many things running on my mind um and pretty much um mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends uh even though i know that they're gonna come <co> i mean i'm constantly worried about uh how they are when they come home and so i really can't fall asleep on the weekends most of the time but um and you <y> sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting a good night's sleep i'm just exhausted <ex> exhausted i pass out but it's hard very stressed mm my son is is um has been uh in dealing with some legal issues and um currently is incarcerated and uh it's been really hard yes i've been probably very short moody irritable well i often think about a lot of things that aren't even happening <laughter> my mind just goes from one point a to point b and i don't even know how i got there um you know it's interesting uh yeah no yes about three years ago um my um o_b_g suggested i i uh see a psychiatrist yes well um i've in the process of changing therapists so it's been about because the program that i was in um lost funding and i lost my therapist or the therapist that i was working with and so it's been about two months maybe three now and um but i did notice when i was in therapy um that it was just an intricate part of my my life my week to see my therapist um it really helped me cope um <sigh> when i picked up my son <laughter> up from um when he was released from um jail um a go getter uh probably you know uh she would use the term hustler but meaning that i'll i'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to do what i need to do to support my family i mean you know legally of course um outgoing um maybe sometimes a little too for too outgoing for her um and compassionate sensitive loyal mm all the things that remind me of my mother <laughter> well yelling the yelling part was one um just <j> just the little things that used to drive me so crazy i see <s> can see myself doing them and it bothers me a lot regarding what mm <clears throat> um not too much really i don't know <clears throat> to go to college right after high school and not wait um and <sigh> that i didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy or that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and not in a relationship and still be happy and live life um what did i do mm i visited my son yesterday and that was really good yeah i was happy that he was safe um my children and uh my accomplishments in um school and work bye

Journal  and I talked to someone that and I care about let him know that I love him  probably too good  I think I keep  things inside maybe sometimes I'm free pretty patient I kind of  put it all on my shoulders and  well ya know once or twice  things built up and I didn't Express them  so it eventually led to like erratic Behavior because it kind of came out in like spurts are like bursts  and a bunch of stuff is like Unleashed it once  instead of you know normally something happens it gets released when this case  something got released it was like a hundred things got released at 1 cuz it all been saved up  the last time I argue with someone  probably with  when I  broke up with my girlfriend before I  was  deployed overseas  yeah I didn't  back the way I handle that  I kind of just laughed and pretending not to care anymore  she didn't deserve that her family didn't deserve that  it's been pretty good to me  starcycle erase  yes  18  because I am I want to serve my country I was born in New York and New York was hit the timer 11th and I was 17  and I  do I want to go to college so why not  termite country  yes all in all yes it was tough it was tough but  and you are  I needed to get that dose of reality  kind of a pretty drastic change from make a wish there had been more of a gradual increase in the intensity of experience  I got a little overwhelmed at times but  Made Me Stronger in the end  yes  Acme  you know that's a lie like a few maybe 5 or 7 years to completely kind of a simile my experience but only like me in the first 6 months after  I got out of the army was a little strained I kind of just  did nothing cuz I don't even so structure for so long and I was just like  I'm living on my own schedule not doing anything yeah and then  you know I was coming sometime after that just to kind of figure out what I wanted to do in life  I went back to school or went went went to college for the first time started playing basketball game for college and  if we kept that up last couple years I just started  coaching basketball in  doing some computer training learning networks do networking  and it's right now I'm right now I'm writing a book on  what I've learned  Aurora  really good really  really free like I'm creating my own future now for the first time  and a long long time  yeah yeah  it's been a little bit  what's the word like I knew on the edge  no not not like  since  I'm the biggest thing I change my behavior was signed to meditate  for sure so did that for the first time by 3 years ago  and  that  the pretty much brought me back to myself I kind of like you know what I consider to be like my true self  so that doesn't change my behavior has now I'm acting more from  my heart instead of like reacting to like my thoughts about to pass the future  nine times Outta ten  Ashley pretty great  when I don't sleep well it's pretty clear I'm pretty I'm pretty quiet I kind of keep to myself  I don't have that like sparkle I don't have that like  valakut attack energy know that energy to go out and get go out and get it right now  little bit tired didn't sleep that great last night  so they went to bed late and I'm going to go to bed like 9:10 last night I went to bed at like 1 and I'm helping a friend move  so yeah today I'm feeling I'm a little bit like black  no  not really  no I never been diagnosed I went to a. Where  you know the first two or three years after I was in the Army and I kind of wanted life to be the way it was before I joined the army things I think there wasn't a lot simpler than to me and a lot more manageable and then I got hurt while playing basketball  and you know so I couldn't like play Hoops for a while for like 2 years and I'd say like I was pretty. I was pretty down during that.

i'm proud that i can actually like you know be a person who can realize okay i have a problem and i need help but a lot of the people i know they don't take medication they're untreated and um they just don't wanna get any help and i'm glad to get help because i don't wanna feel that way and i wanna get help for the problem instead of doing that  oh gosh there's a lot i regret yeah there's a lot um i regret you know uh drug abuse you know but that's part of you know the p_t_s_d i regret um a lot uh mistakes you know relationships stuff like that  wow um i would've told myself to um i guess

395,female,0,7,so now I'm going to give you the doorbell again when she's done chatting  okay great thanks  and please  are you okay with  yes  I'm doing fine  California here in Los Angeles  I love being near the beach and I love the beach I love living in a big city and I love the fact that I have lots of friends and family here  traffic  just so many sometimes too many people but apart from that I I'm generally happy here  okay  photography and language studies  I love photography I was always interested in it and set it in high school as well so I wanted to continue to learn more about it and with languages I come from a mixed background so I wanted to learn languages of my ethnic background  how hard is that it wasn't hard it was a passion so I enjoyed it  are you still working  I'm not no  to do photography full-time and also to do some of the things that I'm passionate about more creatively more creative things  like what I have an idea I'd like to do make some like a robe Line women's robes and things like that  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I have a travel quite a bit and I didn't I love travel  seeing different cultures different countries meeting new people all about and the language  am I lived in Greece for over a year I taught English there and I moved around to different parts of Greece and really had a great time  I think just having my group of friends that I met there and going through the experience with them I think one of my most memorable experiences was going to Elephant ethos in a car with everybody and having a just a fantastic time  yes it was  I think I'm shy to begin with and and as I get to know people that I'm much more outgoing  Photography in language studies  I turn on  it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got.  how much is a stay-at-home maybe watch a movie  rest in bed watching a movie in bed that's probably one of the things I like to do to relax  I think very good  it was probably with my boyfriend  regarding money issues  I need to I feel guilty about not generating as much income as I need to right now  I'm having some struggles in my career right now and financially it's becoming very difficult  I'm sorry  sounds really hard had two husbands been difficult but I've been working very hard to to remedy that  great  so well I'm here and then I'm doing this this Focus study I'm doing him any things to generate more money working harder but looking for other ways to generate money outside of my my career  probably being raped  have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD  no  you have concerning thoughts  sometimes  are they triggered by something  not that I'm aware of  how you been feeling lately  I've been feeling stressed  I've been feeling  been feeling stressed and worried  how easy is it  I don't seem to have any problem with it might seem to get a good night sleep almost every night  I'm grumpy and and lethargic and in the morning  situation I wish I would have handled differently  I really can't think of one right now  the hardest decision I've ever had to make  was probably deciding to not have the child  can you tell me if  well I was pregnant and  wasn't sure whether or not I should continue the pregnancy and that was also due to financial burden and the father of all was involved with did not want the child so I made that very very difficult decision  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  really really happy  I know when I went to Cancun on a holiday over the new year new year. Near holiday  I felt absolutely fantastic I felt happy I felt relaxed I felt like I didn't have a care in the world to temporarily free  what are some things you wish you could change about you  I wish I could be a little bit stronger and more assertive  definitely more assertive  I would say I'm a wonderful wonderful friend when I left somebody you know I love them very deeply friends family  boyfriend so I think that's good I'm very loyal as a friend I'm honest I care about people I'm fun to be with so I think those are some of my best qualities  my relationship with my family with my father is not so great my parents were divorced when I was young and he's sort of been in and out of my life you know forever mostly out so that it's not fantastic but but it's something that I'm used to so it's not as painful as it would be a Patty been there and then I lost him but it's it's still it's still it's still not the best situation I mean I still wish that could be remedied some  there's good and bad relationships in my family  who's some of the positive influence in your life  someone that's been there for me since I was very very young and is always been just incredible when I love her so much  what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  10 or 20 years ago I would have told myself to work harder than and not have so much fun so I don't have to work so hard now  a guy regret exactly that I regret I'm not taking my career seriously earlier on because now it's been it's been much harder  tell me about something you did read  I think it was taking the kids to the pier and spending some wonderful time with them and making them happy that was probably a great time I'm one of the best times in the last few weeks  and and they're they're great kids  you find it easy to be a parent  no I think they're there it's challenging it is more difficult because their stepchildren so there are some times when I'm not sure exactly how much to get involved and how much not to get involved but we're very lucky because they are really good kids they do tend to fight a lot but  but I but it's not as difficult as I think some other parents have it  what are some ways that your  and your pet  I made it make a make a conscious effort not to not to punish them or over punish them I make a conscious decision not to scream at them the way that I was scream. I was screaming a lot as a child and it was really it was really difficult so I make sure not to do that  what are you most proud of in your life  I think I'm most proud of the fact that I have been able to travel the world  and live in other places many many other places around the country and around the world and the fact that I learned several languages  and that's what I've been able to maintain really long long long relationships with my friends  thanks for sharing your thoughts with me thank you  goodbye  post survey for you to fill out

328,male,0,4,yes <laughter>  fine how are you uh watts california but now i live in west l_a  <laughter> yes i love uh the sunshine i love the palm trees i love that um you're thirty minutes away from everything it's a great city   the traffic it's terrible  i studied child development  yeah actually i uh teach children how to be safe in uh traffic situations  oh my dream job is to be a filmmaker that's what i wanna do i wanna die doing that job making movies  well when i was uh in high school i did a lot of drama theater productions and i just love everything about film so once i had the opportunity to actually make a film uh because i wasn't getting any work as an actor i just got hooked i just love making film <laughter>  last time i made a film just this last october made a short film  <laughter> it's about three people that connect together they're completely unrelated but they get to a retreat where they realize that their problems are bigger than what they imagined originally thanks <laughter>  really mad uh  <laughter> really mad i you know i guess what makes me really mad is when my daughter acts stupid at school when she does not do her work and uh when she doesn't pay attention and i have to get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent conferences that's what makes me mad  yeah  <laughter> yeah yeah it sucks she's one of the smartest kids in her school  no it's it's it's very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that you find are negative go to them and it's like you're fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you you know times a hundred and it's just difficult to deal with that but um other than that it it's okay but it's being a parent is never easy   <sigh>  the hardest thing about being a parent  i would say is trying to give that little person so much life experience so that they don't make mistakes or so that they don't get hurt and you wanna give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so it gets very uh  um annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the info and they don't wanna take it they wanna find their own way and to watch them get hurt it's it's sad and then they wanna come to you and you're like ugh i tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way so    mm yeah i guess for a while when when you think about it uh when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch but it's a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they wanna learn 'cause once they get it they got it so however they get it you as a parent you're happy they got it  <sigh> all the love the children bestow upon you it's great they  yeah they love <lo> you know love you and all especially my daughter she always wants to give me hugs she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me uh she always tells me i'm doing a great job when i'm like <laughter> what does she know about a great job she's only seven but you know they have that unconditional love and you just can't help but feel like a good person for having the children tell you that you're a good person so i like that  hmm oh <laughter> my god they're ooh <sigh> they're you know it like albert einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity and there's so much technology out there kids are learning so fast it's almost like they're already little adults but they're missing the steps to being a child they miss going outside they miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to youtube or you know wherever facebook and and getting it so fast and they don't know what to do with all this information and they just have to fight through all that info and they the it's not organic anymore children growing up these days it's not organic it's sped up it's pushed and it's just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this world so that's what's wrong hmm me <laughter> just <sharp inhale> breathe in <sharp exhale> and breathe out or i'll just walk away from the situation  argued  i argued with my fiancee uh a couple months ago about gosh i forgot i i forgot i don't remember  it was petty yeah but it didn't last long 'cause she's like me she doesn't like to argue about stuff we like to take care of stuff as it happens and that's it hmm my fiancee <laughter> well um well i mean we met um when i was working at at a charter <ch> not a charter school but at a recreational center we met there and uh we talked we hit it off uh we didn't see each other for an entire year and then uh we reconnected and we went on a date and it was great ever since my family we're pretty close my brother lives in colorado my sister lives in oklahoma i have a dad that lives in a neighboring city where i am um as close as we can be with the distance and certain choices that my family have made over the years you know being far away and um but my immediate family like you know my fiancee and my daughter like we're close and it's great <laughter> i don't travel enough but i have traveled a couple of times uh within the last five years i just came back from new zealand so that was a great experience  yeah  i enjoy meeting new people that's the biggest thing about traveling i like seeing new things i like just immersing myself in different cultures and situations and i like just being away from it all that's that's good too well i went to new zealand uh not too long ago and i had <ha> stayed there for a week um i learned about celsius 'cause you know here we have fahrenheit and that was fun uh i learned how to play cricket   uh i learned how to get myself out of a capsized kayak and um i learned that they have a lot of lamb lamb is good i like lamb but they had a lot of lamb oh and their seafood <seaf> seafood i can't eat but they do have really great chocolate chocolate is <sigh> it was so good and ice cream was good too and uh the people were really really nice they it was a very special time for me to go there it was great and they accepted me i love that and yeah can't wait to go back  <laughter> yes it was some of my best qualities um energetic uh very personable uh intelligent i am easy to get along with i work pretty hard and i'm very slow to getting upset about things  no  no no mm it's fairly easy  <laughter> uh i guess i get pretty moody you know i could be a little little snappy at people when i don't sleep well when i have lack of sleep but once i get some sleep in me i'm okay mm fine  no no no changes no scrubbed_entry um you know he would say that i'm pretty funny um lax about a lot of things uh i enjoy life as much as i possibly can um good friend to have around and always ready and eager to help <laughter> just waking up in the morning <laughter> it's always a great thing uh i love ice cream that's always good i love laughing ugh if somebody's laughing especially my fiancee 'cause she has a great laugh then that puts me in a good mood hmm thank you  scrubbed_entry and that's what i wanna do i definitely wanna get into acting and really work it and get some really good roles so he's been a positive influence he stayed out of trouble um he's maintained a good working relationship with people and he's always positive and very super helpful and very encouraging      oh we went to junior high school and high school together so he's my best friend  yeah  <laughter> yes it is  wow there's so many uh  scrubbed_entry had uh these bag of m and m's and we had went to a play and there were two girls that were a couple of rows down that you know we didn't particularly care for but you know that's how kids are you just they don't know how to you know they say they don't like somebody but you know anyway but we got these m and m's and while the it was dark we start throwing m and m's and hitting 'em in the head with the m and m's and then we came to school like three days later uh we were summoned and there was a mock trial to get scrubbed_entry so we were able to get ourselves off on like the entire group had found us not guilty of the crime and but then we got in trouble anyway because our teacher just wouldn't allow us to not get in trouble so we had to clean up the yard for like two days  oh man you name it uh i love scuba diving i've only done it twice but i love it wanna get back into it like traveling uh i love exercising i actually like working out now uh i used to think it was a chore but now i'm really really getting into it that i love watching movies you put me in front of a good movie and i'm a happy camper so that's about it hanging out with family  anything i regret hmm <deep breath> you know what i think i <laughter> i probably regret not going up to will smith when i had the chance  yeah uh will smith was coming up the street and i saw him and i got so nervous i jumped in the bushes and i didn't meet him uh my boss at the time thought it was really funny but i just i wasn't ready to meet him yet so but i think i regret meeting him   advice i would give myself ten or twenty years ago i would probably say that when my gut told me to do something i should've just went on ahead and did it rather than sit and analyze it you know days weeks months later if i feel it in my gut i should go for it so go with my gut more  really happy  hmm really happy i i had a film festival that i was putting together and things were so intense we things were going wrong but then things were going right but then once the people came and packed the house i was really happy that we had a packed house at this uh film festival so this was about a month ago  yeah  <sigh> let's see i think right now at this point i'm most proud of putting a short film together with a minimal budget but it has amazing actors it has a great storyline and i didn't think it could be done but it's done or close to being done and i'm i'm proud of that i was able to get it done i think i could walk away happy knowing that i gave it a really good shot and i think this movie is probably going to take me and the rest of my film crew buddies to higher heights oh really  alright well what was your name again  ah ellie  goodbye 
426,male,1,20,<sync. yes i'm alright south l_a um the weather the women the opportunities that's about it racism police brutality injustice that's it mm no not much of a exploring type of person um psychology mhm um it was one of the classes i excelled in the most so i decided to change it from business to psychology yeah yes no to own my own record label um it it's moderately hard but you know take it one day at a time just i guess you know stay focused a little bit of both um i tend to be shy in um situations i'm not comfortable with or i'm new to and i'm outgoing in places i'm more comfortable with yeah <laughter> um turn the lights down low and listen to soft music mhm i'm getting better over the years um i think i'm pretty decent now compared to how i used to be yes ma'am um due to the lack of i guess you could say controlling my emotions i have uh gotten incarcerated sent to prison yeah mm i'm not sure uh i don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision i've made in my life um it was probably a few days ago with the girl i was talking to and i was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness yeah uh frustrated because um you know uh you you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect you know the same effort by the other person when you're in a relationship and at the same time when you when you have expectations sometimes you kinda set yourself up for failure so you know i guess i'm just learning there's a lot of situations i would've handled differently um probably the most recent was uh i had gotten into a physical <phy> a physical altercation with an inmate when i was incarcerated and that made me that's what sent me to prison and and i had to do a lot more time and um if i handled it differently i probably would've never went to prison i probably would've been home a lot sooner than i originally happen yeah mm there are several events i wish i could erase from my memory um probably uh my first girlfriend um she did something really uh extreme it wasn't necessary in my eyes and it and it cost <co> it could've cost me my life i think that that that's a recurring thought that i i wish i could completely erase from my memory along with the good memories as well um a few you few fights uh i guess you could say shoot outs um getting jumped getting robbed you know those things i think those inhibit me i guess to to explore certain areas of life that i'm not comfortable with so those are the feww things that it'd be nice if i could erase it completely yeah <sigh> hurting people that didn't need to be hurt emotionally especially um a few women in my life or in my past um probably putting my mother through certain things that she didn't have to go through along with my close friends and family as well um used to be rocky growing up but as i got older and matured and the certain experiences that i've been through kind of brought me closer to my family so now it's it it's pretty decent it's it's pretty decent mm i would say my mother um yeah my mother um well she she uh she had her share of experiences negative and positive um i admire her the struggles she's been through um she she she uh experienced difficult economic hardships growing up but that didn't stop her um from raising a son at a young age finishing school getting her master's and just just overall being a a good person and she also battled mental health issues as well and um probably not the best of family that she could've been raised with so she so she's kinda of like a a inspiration to to me and other people as well so i would say my mother mm it's not easy so yeah it's not easy i couldn't tell you i i i've always had sleeping issues um i usually just take uh like over the counter sleep medication or nyquil but it makes you drowsy the next morning so it's like it's a negative effect really yeah the medication <medi> i don't know shit i don't know but i just stopped taking it 'cause i didn't like feeling drowsy not good at all um yeah i mean i recently got released from prison not too long ago uh i'm older now and a lot more responsibilities and i feel like my life is not where it's supposed to be i feel like i could've made a lot more better decisions in my life you know sometimes feeling sorry for myself and just things that i've been through and the whole nine yards so yeah it's all good yeah so true yes <sniffle> about two and a half three years ago <deep breath> <sigh> myself i um i was i was just tired of not i don't know i guess school kind of made me seek help because i started to understand myself how my brain works um you know so i decided to seek help maybe to better my life yeah you could say that yes i am yes yes i do actually i do mm better decision making um better tools to reflect on choices um how to control uh certain situations better yeah um <sniffle> well instead of just always reacting on emotion no matter what kind of emotion it is i step back and and and i assess the situation you know to see what's what's the best way to to react towards the situation and by doing that it has made me more mature emotionally more mature and just has a positive outcome <laughter> um i was lying next to a beautiful woman who who cared about me and the feeling was mutual so that was probably the most happy oh my goodness spontaneous um outgoing sometimes a little crazy um fun that's about it nothing um like i said earlier just you know hurting the the few women that were in my life my past and my friends and family that's about it oh shit uh school is really important um how i carry myself the people who i surround myself with and what i choose to do in my free time those are the few things i would tell myself good music um a good game of basketball um

463,male,0,0,okay cool  hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today  yes I am  I am pretty good  I was born in Los Angeles California  yes  I like the fact that everything is closed by all the stores and shops  the traffic  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot of trouble but not too much  going away from your usual days exploring new sites  3 weeks notice a month ago I went to Las Vegas with me and my friends and we just went sightseeing  in Las Vegas we went to the Hoover Dam and it was breathtaking the it was really big and we saw the Big Canyon and it was impressive I never seen something like that before  I studied nursing  I graduated two months ago so I took my board exam to be licensed and I passed so I'm just waiting for my license in the mail  my dream job is to be a registered nurse  long time ago when I was a little boy I got injured and my parents had to take me to the hospital and the doctors came by and they had to stitch me up on the leg and I saw all of that and that made me want to pursue the medical field  are you happy  yes I am very happy  my relationship with my family is okay not good not bad it's if it's in between  I am close I am very close to them if I have a problem or I go to them for help  someone who's been a positive influence has been my best friend since elementary school  yes  yes we've known each other since we were in the third grade and we've we've gone to a lemon tree middle school and high school together and he lives like two blocks away so he's basically like like a brother of mine  I am shy  I really don't know I've always been a quiet person ever since I can remember  what do I do if I  I going to my room I turn my AC on and I just relax in my bed  I am pretty good I'm pretty good at controlling my temper yes  the last time I argued with someone was about  work  I was disappointed not angry just disappointed  because my manager he wanted me to do something faster than what I usually can handle and he already knew that my workload was a lot but he didn't understand that so that made me just very like sad  I cannot remember one  the hardest decision I ever had to make was  dropping out of school  I felt that I didn't really belong far away from home and so I was just thinking ahead I was in a major that I didn't really like and so  I decided to just not go next semester and go back home to LA  are you happy  right now that I'm looking at it yes I am very happy that I did that because I wouldn't have gone to nursing school and I wouldn't have been a licensed vocational nurse right now  I don't have an event  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  it depends on the days where I work or where I don't work  yes right now I I work at at a retail store early in the morning I I go at 3 in the morning and I get out at 10 a.m. so it's really hard for me to get a good night sleep  when I don't sleep well I can be a little bit grumpy irritated or just frustrated with the situation  lately I've been okay I'm been good  no I have not  okay  no  no  the last time I was really really happy and excited was when I found out that I passed my license board exam to be a nurse  my best friend would have just would describe me as a caring nice sweet shy quiet guy  physically speaking I would change how I look from the outside  I am overweight and I would like to lose some weight and just look good from the outside  I don't have one  no I don't  just one time  I at my work it's a retail store I kind of took some merchandise without buying it  what made you decide to do that  it was a risk that I took but since no one was around and D up the opportunity was right there for me to get it I just got it and I took it home  I don't know  yes last weekend I went to I went yard selling with my family and it was pretty fun going out to different yard sales and finding random stuff  I bought this big black bean bag it was huge and it was on it was only for $2 and so I got it and now it's in my room and I sit on it  I am most proud of is the fact that I am a nurse that I am a nurse I'm just waiting for my for my license in the mail and after that I would just send out my resumes to different hospitals and call Aunt nursing homes  I think I got everything I need  thanks for sharing your thoughts  bye

462,female,0,9,alright wonderful  okay thanks  yeah  I'm okay  I'm from Los Angeles  oh the weather the weather the weather the weather the beach the weather the beach the laid-back miss the driving instead of public transportation  and a sporty  I really I don't know the lack of I don't know there's not a lot I don't like about Olay it's compared to most cities I really it's my favorite and I've lived around the world I love it I love La a lot  I'm sure you can tell by me  yes I've lived in Paris and I've been around the world a lot  it's just dumb it's fun and it's it's it's it's it's a blast it's good to see new places it's good to get to get to experience all the  fantastic I'm sites and in in cultures  well I mean I I I tended to actually do a lot of them I probably would do them differently I think I'm more developed as a person now I lived in Paris for two years so and I lived in Spain for Spain was fun Spain Madrid is a party town and then and then to these were all work they were all work so that was working so it was on his grind and you didn't really appreciate you know what was around you so much and then I mean I still I still love going just to you know vacation spots like a Y A N Dent Tamika I'm still just really a sucker for that kind of stuff  I guess Madagascar was pretty much like just really bitching because it was it was in the eighties and it was like you were seeing a lot of people that have never seen white people before according to the guy driving us around I might he might have been lying but it was just it was bitching and Africa was pretty much the best Senegal and Madagascar  I'm right now about to go for an early childhood education degree and then I did a little bit of a paralegal but that was really just to just to get the just to get the Skype and I didn't really have any concept of what I want to do now I really do  I have I was saying to Rachel actually I don't know if you guys are able to overhear I really think that the way the school system goes right now is it just it it turns people into into I'm just a just a doggy dog. You know I don't like the way I think it's told draining the school system right now and I feel pretty bad for everybody so I want to try to fix that  that would be my dream job that's so I'm excited like I want to go in a direction that I want to go and yeah that would be my dream job is to work with sort of getting kids on it more organic Universal you know trajectory  I think it could be done I don't think it would be done via any sort of legislation except here and there I mean that always ends up becoming you know facade in Farsi itself anyway but I think there are ways I've always reached kids anyway and I've always felt where I was coming from and so I think you know there are ways to sort of buck the system without even talking to the system  I guess I'm just a combination of the two I don't think  I don't know actually I'm kind of might even be working that out there might be some outgoingness to overcompensate for what's actually shyness and vice versa.  Yeah that's cool  I definitely try to reflect and stay in a pretty Lucid space is often as possible so  a lot of lying down at the moment I'm in transition so there's just a lot of and I hang out with my dog's a lot so that's quite soothing why I try not to do I don't really do anything that's to can't unless it's time for like time to drive to a job or time to you know go make some things happen meetings and stuff but otherwise I try to stay in a pretty relaxed space most of the time so it's not like breaking but you know and I meant I'm assuming I can't believe summer is coming so I'm going to swim some more to  when I'm truly outraged it comes out and then I I'm I'm I'm hitting some kind of bad part right next time I'm fighting for my child so there are times when I will just cuss up a storm just to get off some steam  a little bit but usually pretty much there's always you know someone in the periphery that gets it and and you know it's like that bumper sticker If you're not outraged you're not paying attention so usually some kind of Sanity can prevail  oh well I mean these are also times where I just can't find something in the car and a bit when I argue with people it's been a lot of the times when I'm being flat out you know sabotage drawer definitely when  you know I lost my temper dreadfully with unfortunately the woman that gave me birth because that she is intrinsic and a lot of I mean she's pretty much horrible person so I recently lost my temper with her  I felt like  I mean I I like again I think I should have said this just now I felt in a way good because I get it you know which is as opposed to not getting it which is even worse but I guess there's another side of the bank of the thing to get to to where you can be a little more constructive about it it's like you know you get to a point where you're glad you can actually see that there's a horrible travesty going on but then you have to figure out how to deal with a horrible try to stay  but so I mean I didn't feel like shame I really honestly didn't feel shame I didn't I didn't feel there times when I feel like it was stupid to lose my temper just because there are people that will try to use that against you that's all but I never really feel bad for being angry about what I'm angry about  well when I was pregnant I wish I had  like I said I went through such an Awakening about realizing when I was being sort of undermined that that demanding my respect became a huge issue and when I was pregnant I ended up being so disrespected in the place cuz I was being a hippie on the beach for 6 years so I was it felt like I was being so disrespected in the place where I was set to be when the child arrived at I stormed out via what was a good survival mode before but left me jumping out of the frying pan Into the Fire and they got my kid so  yeah  it's fucked up  I don't want to erase anything from my memory I like having everything Consolidated and cohesive I don't and integrated I don't want to erase anything from my memory  well did I get it right or did I get it wrong I guess the hardest decision was whether or not to sign sign mediation agreement with DCFS in and I should have said no let's just go straight to court because that there is nothing wrong with me I just happened to succumb to an SSI check via bulshit with my mother's and I should have just been you know brave enough to just go in there and do that and instead I chickened out and did their mediation and they played me out  over consciousness  it's horrific horrendous Borgia quality Intrigue and sabotaged it's bad  that's okay  someone that I mean  there's been  you know there's been some  some great people that again from a far I have not sort of really achieved a real great ability to build relationships and I'm working through that great writing it right now and I think that's a lot why don't I have my son but as I've grown in developed I have seen encouragement from like-minded souls and you can see that and say that's wonderful and but otherwise you know a constant you know contact with someone that's really good for me it has been hard for me to get to that point  how is your day  not so easy if he says it all  I'm being I've been I'm not completely centered and then there's been some actual you know people thinking it's funny to harass me or jolt me as they walked by and so there's been actual harassment and stuff like that  I'm still pretty Pollyanna doubt I still look forward to head and try to be as pleasant as possible  I'm tired and drained and a little bit frustrated because that I know that I've been sort of that I sort of have a bit of my energy and and space being usurped and I can tell and I don't know how to get through that and passed it  no  no  there are I'm basically a very very very happy pretty much list out person but this fighting for my son has me sort of trudging areas that it is it the same trees that were thrown in my Road in childhood before I realize I was such a happy person or thrown there again so I'm going through some of the same pitfalls and mistakes but you know during the day I'll I'll think something completely true and organic and I'll just stare at something to wow that's beautiful and I'll be reminded pretty close to my spirit so I try to stay there 24/7 I'm pretty spiritual that way  I mean if I had one that was willing to say all the nice things about me gets pretty competitive out there that you know that I'm this is off you guys  that I'm funny and that and that  I think that's bad I'm done funny and that I'm good and that that I'm trustworthy  Legacy West  just not necessarily change but grow through my ability to connect with the people I want to connect with  and disconnect from the people that manage to to drain me  I already said I regret the thing with them leaving the place where I could have delivered my son even though I was being abused  get the fuck away from your mother  you know and like a lot of  and and yeah and two open your eyes look what look what's going on  I'm proud of my spirit and my Outlook and my my access to what's really going on in the world and my awakeness I'm just proud of me as a person  okay  you're welcome  bye  it's okay it's the old thing yeah it's the old test the other one likes heard of two questions ago
365,male,1,12,<synch> sure i'm doing alright new jersey yes three months ago not very often uh it's much different uh i don't know it's just <laughter> it's a lot more crowded here to start a new life for myself it wasn't very easy at all <sigh> uh it was uh it was quite rough at first but you know i'm still trying to get used to life here i've met some good friends here um you know i love the hollywood area um and just you know the mountains are beautiful that's kinda things i love hmm the traffic not really no i don't just haven't had the time or the finances to digital media well i've always loved you know <deep breath> computers and you know designing things and uh i don't know i just kinda fell into it no i dropped out well i i guess my dream job would be working <deep breath> in something that uh i went to school for you know i i never really completed my education um but i guess it'd be great if i went you know back to school and you know finished you know my degree in digital media and uh you know finished and uh started working you know doing something in that field a little bit of both you know i i can be shy at times but i like to push myself to be outgoing you know it's kind of a a struggle for me but i i don't wanna be you know in a shell so i kinda force myself to be outgoing listen to music i uh sometimes just drive and um you know play music in my car and that helps me relax or i smoke a cigarette oh like what ooh um <laughter> just heavy metal that's all i listen to is metal well <sigh> it depends on how high my stress level is and how angry i am but i i do my best to not get so pissed off <laughter> scrubbed_entry and i don't know she um she wanted me to to come and pick her up uh she was a little drunk and uh we just kinda fought over the phone all over some other things and i just ended not picking her up because of her attitude on the phone with me <laughter> yeah it does something i feel guilty about is uh not talking to my kids uh often or as often as i should i've just been so busy with trying to get myself all situated here that i i don't really have time to you know talk to my kids as much as i'd like to you have no idea um it's it comes natural but it's no way easy and uh it's it's the hardest job that i love to do but right now it's extremely difficult for me because they live so far away and i i made this choice to come out here to l_a and i feel bad that i don't see them you know but the reason i came out here was to better myself so i can provide for them fear you know fear <f> just fear will you know you <y> you fear what's gonna happen to your kids you fear that something awful is gonna happen and not seeing them it brings about that fear a lot more you know and i can't i can't always be there with them i can't see them you know it it wasn't as bad when i was living in florida um and i i at least i used to see them it wasn't very often but i used to used to see them now i don't see them at all and that's the that's the hardest thing i've had to do as a parent is to step away from my kids if only temporarily i don't know how long i'm gonna be here for i don't know what my future holds but the hardest thing is being so far away from them just the the joy that they bring to me i mean i could be having a bad day and they just cheer me right up i mean i eh it sucks being away from them for for so long and they're so far away and just not seeing their faces that's it's it's the worst thing ever you know but i i love to just see their faces they they just bring a smile to my face and um i don't know well um i think the fact that i can get down to their level um i'm i'm a bit goofier <laughter> as a father than my dad was with me my dad was you know strict all the time sure he used to you know laugh and play with us but you know he was always very reserved you know and he kinda held back a lot he a lot of his emotions just because you know he was a he was a strong very tough guy um but with me i i i'm very goofy and silly with my kids and i'm strict when i have to be but i always love to you know play around with them as much as possible you know not i don't want them to grow up too fast and that that may have been yeah well <sigh> a situation that i wish i would've handled differently there's so many <laughter> uh i guess when i was still with my ex-wife in florida i wish i wouldn't have gotten so angry or i wish i wouldn't have let her get the best of my emotions she had a tendency to get underneath my skin and uh you know keep picking at me until i exploded and i allowed her to do that you know i i should've just walked away when i could and um you know not let my temper get the best of me no no no uh sometimes it's hard um sometimes i just lay awake in bed <sigh> you know thinking all the things that are going through my head all the you know all the stress that i'm going through with work and you know making sure you know wondering if i'm gonna if i'm gonna be able to make you know rent you know wondering what my kids are going through you know when i'll see them again if they even care about me anymore if they even know they have a father you know those are some of the things that run through my head and and that keeps me up at night sometimes a little <sigh> but <sigh> you know i put myself in this situation so you know i i gotta bear with it you know i gotta you know you reap what you sow so i <sigh> i gotta deal with it in my own way lately um i've been trying to not think so much about you know all that's going into my life uh i try to distract myself and that kind of gets me in a better mood you know if i'm hanging out with friends or just watch a little t_v something to get my mind off you know all the stresses in my life um the last time i felt really happy uh was actually a couple of nights ago i went out drinking with um with a couple of my friends from work and um i don't know we just got pretty drunk and just <laughter> that kinda helped me to forget all the crap that was previously going through my head so if if i can distract myself if i can forget about all that other stuff then i'm happy <sigh> some of my best qualities i guess that i'm convincing <laughter> um uh i'm kind of like a i guess you would say a counselor to some people you know some of my close friends you know i may talk people into doing things that they may regret or i may i mean i'm sorry take talk people out of things that they you know may end up regretting or i may um you know just listen to people so you know eh i could say that you know i definitely you know listen to my friends and help them out in their time of need when they're going through something troubling times like like i'm going through scrubbed_entry uh who lives in florida you know i talk to him every now and then and he's been having troubles with his girlfriend and you know i just kind of talk to him about his problems and listen i mostly <mo> i mainly listen because you know i don't think he has anybody else to listen to you know when i was living in florida i was uh very close with him so you know he he'd always relied on me and now that i'm here in l_a i don't wanna lose that you know connection with him because i mean i've always been there for him so he um he relies on me to listen to his problems and give him some advice you know about what i think you know he should do um so i think <th> i think he appreciates that and i and i'm glad that he you know relies on me for that uh he trusts me enough to tell me all that stuff <laughter> i don't know <sigh> um sometimes i wish i wasn't so kind or generous it seems bad but sometimes i i don't know people may take advantage of me and i may not realize it and um i don't like saying no to people i like to always please people so if i can change that maybe i wish i wasn't such a people pleaser sometimes financially in trouble <laughter> <deep breath> sometimes i you know it you know help others and not you know that may make me broke sometimes yeah i may not have enough to pay bills but i feel better helping people i don't know i regret not breaking up with my ex-wife sooner i regret <re> i regret <re> because she put me through so much crap in my life and um i was always trying to be a people pleaser i was trying to please her you know trying to please my kids as much as i can by not breaking up you know the family but you know there's only so much one person can take and i i think probably if i would've left sooner i may have been happier and things may not have gotten so out of control out of hand like they did you know during all those years with her so maybe if i would've got out sooner i don't know i would've been happier i guess um it's okay to be selfish it's okay to you know think about yourself sometimes you know if you keep putting everyone ahead of you then you're not thinking about yourself you're not thinking about what makes you happy and even though pleasing people may make you happy uh you have to think about yourself sometimes too and about your needs because you know you play an important role in the lives of your close family members and um in order to keep everything afloat you sometimes gotta xxx gotta worry about the one person that's you know juggling everything and holding everything up which is yourself so be a little selfish sometimes it's okay <laughter> i don't even know what a weekend is anymore my ideal weekend would be locked away alone in my room watching movies listening to music just with my cell phone off and not you know being with anybody or it could be out at a bar you know or you know watching a a metal show so i like to be alone but at times i i do wanna be out with uh with others i like you know being around people crazy <laughter> he thinks i'm uh i'm crazy for coming out here but i guess he would say that i'm dedicated and that i'm strong-minded and that you know whatever i set my mind to i can do it you know no matter how hard it is i'm not gonna wimp out so i mean i i really respect him for giving me his insight but uh i guess yeah i guess he would say that i'm crazy but strong-minded <laughter> my kids <sigh> you know that's the one thing that brings joy to me you know like real real joy are my kids and you know just having them in my life is is the proudest thing i can ever accomplish is just you know having them in my life and although i don't get to see them as much even <e> even when i think about them just thinking about you know how far they've gone you know what what they've accomplished in their you know in in their short time i mean eh yeah it makes me happy and i can't wait to see them again one of my most memorable experiences i guess that would be scrubbed_entry in florida you know going to see our uh you know our favorite band skeleton witch it was it was a great night overall you know one of the night's i'll never forget just because we'd been looking forward to it for you know so many months and you know when it finally happened it was surreal um it was it was a great night after all and overall sure you're welcome bye

So you know like the people but yes I like them the  attitude you know the LA attitude so yeah  I don't like I don't like some of the policies with regard to the smoking you know I really wish that the government would crack down on smoking on the streets make it like USC yeah  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a  no not outside of but getting on the bus and things like that  I was studying to be a nurse  yeah  I wanted to have a job that pays well but afforded me the opportunity to use my service gift so yeah  no I had to put that put that on the side and I want to get a business degree now  yeah my dream job is  is 2  create new technology  can you tell me about that  other than to say I would like to create something that will change the world like Steve Jobs with his iPhone  yeah  I am it depends on the situation but I'm more outgoing  I do tend toward the little shyness from time to time  what I do is I'll go to the movies  I went to the movies probably like maybe 5 weeks ago  yeah  well I had an argument recently not really argument but a disagreement with a woman at my church who is over this particular Department that I'm in and it's a volunteer position I use my Administrative Assistant more executive assistant skills to to I do minutes for meetings that I cover and until then I have to produce the minutes and send them to everybody and things like that and this person is micromanaging me but not micromanaging the other admin assistant who did not get her block of people into this particular meeting so the meeting should have been comprised of a hundred people but we have like maybe 30 even 3020  yes so now she doesn't know that I realize you know that part of it so there was a little bit of a argument and but again not a argument but a disagreement and when we talk again I will point out to the person that's over both of us that there is a disconnect and the energies she's investing in me is unprofitable for what we're trying to achieve  that does not sound good  well a little attacked  you know so  it depends on I'm very good at controlling my temper it's you know there are places where you can allow your temper to come out even though it might not be appropriate and then there are other places where if it comes out then you shot yourself in the foot so I'm pretty good at controlling my temper  yeah  I don't have any situation recent that I can think of  probably say just dealing with a neighbor instead of responding to the neighbor just ignore the neighbor all together so I wish I'd done that differently  yeah  thankfully  I've not had to make that type of decision in my life as yet  I have what I do in my life and then and you know in my  going forward you know everything that I've done and everything that has happened I  accept it as something that has to be to get me to go for it I am a born again Christian and so I know that that God is Sovereign over my life and also that according to his word the Bible says that everyday of our life is written in his book so events and circumstances I feel that I feel they are ordained by God not obviously I'm not going to jump into a burning fire or do anything ridiculous but  I feel that things that have that have happened even if I've dealt with them the wrong way it's God's his total sovereignty has control over that and it will work for my good so that's how I feel  I have all brothers and so I'm not really that close with my brothers  and my mother  say that again  people that have grown up with neighbors from when I when I was younger that I was close to different friends that I've had along the way friends who are more like family so yeah  they've had positive influence  that's I get I sleep too well  so I sleep well every night  normal but I my normal I've been feeling my normal  no  no  no  that was really something happened  I was able to participate  with my church on Sunday with I was a Pentecost it was Pentecost Sunday meeting it was 50 days after the resurrection of Jesus Christ and so I was able to participate in a prayer session that we had at my church and I thought that was really made me very happy  that I'm smart they would say that I'm smart that  that I handle difficulties very well  and then I dress well  I don't want to change anything I do want to just be a better me so be a better person so I am working on listening better communicating better and and accepting my  weaknesses better as well as my strengths  no  that's a good question I would have I would have told myself to  to do what I know to do to do what I know that which is right and  I can do what I know is right and let everything else let the other chips fall where they may but to do what I know to do is right and they go forward  I am very proud of the fact that I don't give up  bye and thank you see you all  thank you  I'm deaf
353,female,1,11,yes  i'm okay  um pennsylvania  mhm um well i was in boston for a couple years and then i moved here about three and a half years ago but um i just wasn't satisfied with the quality of my life um maybe once or twice last year i only got to back once a year um definitely safer and um definitely a more um well i just miss it 'cause i have a lot of family back there but l_a is okay i i mean everyone loves the climate here um  not too easy i have two really good friends here and i have a boyfriend i've been with for three years so that helps he's from here but um it definitely took a a bit of adjustment  no um advertising communications  um no i'm currently working in actually i'm not working right now at the moment um i wanna be an osteopathic physician  um so basically versus western medicine an osteopathic physician is someone who helps someone with the symptoms and doesn't just treat the symptoms but treats them as a whole person so they look at nutrition they look at diet exercise um just a variety of things to <t> to actually get someone to live  a healthier life versus medications or things that are commonly prescribed now in the western medicine  um well one of the great things was when i came out here to l_a i was um exposed to the degree which i had never heard of living on the east coast   um sometimes  um well i'm very particular about the people i like to surround myself with um and eh i don't like to socialize with a lot of people i mean i tend to um like small intimate groups and i don't tend to like to be in larger or bigger groups um eh when people don't take into account other people's feelings  um i usually  try to go for a walk if i get <laughter> very irritated  um i'm usually really good it really takes a lot for me to spill over and to yell or become upset   um <sigh> let's see uh mm i was at with my lawyer and it was about his handling of my case  yeah it was he's uh they're i don't know i think they're just a little bit mediocre they're not the best lawyers   i have no idea <laughter>  um i'm very trustworthy i'm loyal um i care very deeply so i i like to try to help other people um and i always like to try to cheer people up so <laughter> i think that's that would be some of 'em  no yes  um just a few months ago about in the last six months  um i was experiencing  mental issues that i'd never really came across before paranoia and anxiety and i knew that it wasn't  um i knew that i it wasn't that i couldn't overcome it by myself  um a lot better i've been doing a lot of yoga and meditation um kinda seeing things from a different per view or another <ano> not per <pe> per view but a different view and um  that's helped but there's definitely times where i kind of sink back into thinking about the event especially because the event caused me to stop working   um  i think i you know i have a difficulty being in public um i'm still dealing with anxiety and paranoia about that and that something may happen so um so a lot of times during the day is when it happened so i'm not that comfortable going out during the day i tend to go out in the mornings and evenings and um i don't like to go into places where there's only one way in and one way out um well i've been gradually trying to increase how much i'm outside um  and i usually just deep breathing um i do a lot of breathing exercises and i just try to say that basically what i'm thinking or what's going on with me is not real um and that   i just i try <laughter> i just try to get myself to go into these places more gradually a lot better since uh the last couple months but before i very much pretty much stayed home    um  it's been good um it's been good to hear someone's feedback but um i feel like i've gotten more help with just my inner talk with just kind of sitting with myself and journaling  i do  um <sigh> well i feel like more like myself which is a huge improvement um and i am more cautious and er guarded in some ways about my thoughts um and about my decisions as well i'm not so i'm not so oh you know i'll just do this and not really think of the consequences of other things that i want in my life   um it's gotten better i'm okay <ok> i'm better now um the first three months it was very difficult i couldn't sleep through the night and i woke maybe two or three times and would be awake for a couple hours but now i am um sleeping through the night again  um i feel <f> groggy <sigh> k i feel foggy and out of it um  and just low kind of depressed  mm <sigh> it's um i think it's been awhile  um working <laughter> i'm a bit of a workaholic um spending time with my family um yeah just being outside enjoying nature reading um very close  what is that  um scrubbed_entry um well my parents 'cause they've always been very supporting and loving um giving me feedback about my decisions or what i'm choosing to do but allowing me to make my own um decisions my own choices in life and then  my sisters have just always been very um you know just always checking with me i'm the baby i'm the youngest in the family so they always um  looking out for me and just checking in with me and then my boyfriend xxx with this um incident that happened um he's been very uh usually supportive with just letting me kind of have my talk and work things out and understanding when i'm feeling and not wanting to go out in public and and being aware of that that it's not so easy for me just to do something like grocery shop or um running errands without having a lot of anxiety  um i'm most proud of  the jobs the work that i've done the people i've helped um  maybe that i took this job where i was assaulted at <laughter> that would be it going into retail into unsafe environment not listening to my gut  um  what advice would i what uh to recklessly pursue your dreams um that there is no such thing as too late or running out of time and and to enjoy every moment of your life not take anything for granted  um  let's see uh <sigh> well cooking i really enjoy <enj> i really enjoy cooking um  so i made some roasted vegetables just any time i'm cooking i just really enjoy it um we have a garden so we had collard greens that came up and um some chilis and cauliflower so just using preparing that for <f> um for my um boyfriend and i  mhm bye thanks 
301,male,0,3,yeah there's also on Craigslist so that's why okay  how are you doing today I'm doing good thank you  I'm from Los Angeles  I'm great  I live in West Los Angeles the west side  it's all right  I live alone so  I love it I'm from here so I grew up here it's natural  the weather on the weather  it's always good you never never bad there's always something to do really dull moment  traffic  the traffic is horrible I'll probably traffic is horrible in almost any major city but I hate the traffic  not really I mean I have enough things going on here so if I travel it's usually somewhere this within driving distance  I study business I didn't  no I've been done for a few years so I haven't gone to school for a while one of these days I'll go back to graduate school but  my dream job would be to just work for myself and make some money  I don't know I don't really have a dream job just something that I can I can work under my own terms and get paid decently and being a creative creative environment  I don't know I think it's just a matter of finding the right situation so right now at its people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they wanted it so it's a little tougher than it should be but I don't know I think when the situation is right I don't think it's too difficult  yep  I work as an administrative assistant through a temp agency so  I just basically has to get sent out to do to do desk jobs  yes or no I mean I feel like I feel like I could do more but now it works so  I'm pretty close there around so  I really mad  stupid people just basically doing doing anything to annoy me  that's because that's the big thing just irritating stupid people just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all  what's a good example  this random people who think it's funny that just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn't have to be one any specific situation it's just people who just think it's funny that I think they're just generally sadistic and they just think it's funny to it just probably like it's like poking a stick and an angry dog knowing that they know how they just want to push your buttons for no reason so  I don't remember what those situations I usually try not to remember when it happens I just I just let it go and just like the past of the past I tend not to look back  what do you mean  okay  at what I do to relax I like to run I like to go to the gym  listen to music a lot of Musician's Friend so I just I'm usually around musicians so anything of that sort I like I like everything from Lockhart to tattoos to just anything that's that's generally art and creative  who's been deposit  they just friends and general who received the we seem to do well and I think they are very inspiring and  which is sometimes a little bit tough and in a town like Los Angeles where I think everybody is on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't it's sometimes hard to find someone who is going to be uplifting or try to be inspiring so  I don't really have anybody in particular but people kind of brought up things here and there  yeah it's like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or egg you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just now I'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe I might I can do differently instead of just being negative thing hey don't do that that's no that's why you doing that it's a waste of time  I guess it depends on who you talk to  I'm okay at it I can probably work at that I don't know I mean I can I think I can do better  go back to the point about people provoking me so I mean I try not to blow Steam and let them get under my skin so I just usually try not to let it get to me but I don't know I guess what temper is it depends on how I handle my stress lately I've been better at it just because I think my situation has been a little bit better  now  now  no  nothing major and maybe when I was younger I could have traveled more I could have worked towards something that paid better job-wise but I mean those are all things that I think at any point in life you always think like why could have should have would have done but you know  but then again I think that's natural for anybody I mean I could I could have become a banker or I could have become a lawyer or doctor made. 10 times the money that I make now but but then again I don't like law and I don't like Madison so so it wasn't meant to be so  yeah  I think  I think my in my life I knew that there's a lot of things I have there's more things in life so I kind of narrowed it down to what am I good at and what am I not good at and what am I going to work well or who am I going to work well with and I not work well with so I kind of I kind of sort it out and then the list kind of  I'm kind of answered itself so  no it's I don't think it was hard but it was just but I think it was a real reality check and I think it's it's kind of a good thing cuz sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense it's like trying to shovel around peg into a square square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not going to go and so sometimes it just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you  memorable experiences  I think it's just I don't really have like anyone in particular I think I think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative I think it's just everything from getting it just the fact that  I got a job and I can I can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person as it sounds stupid but you know I think just the fact that I'm able I'm able to get this far in life without completely self-destructing is already in accomplishments so I feel like  I gotten somewhere  maybe not tonight maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire  yeah  I want the last time I really felt happy  I don't know I'm not really someone who is like  I don't have any real high highs or low lows I mean I haven't hit any Lowe's so I mean  I don't know I'm usually pretty I feel like I'm a level person and I'm pretty everyday I feel like if I accomplish one thing that I'm pretty happy so I guess the answer the question probably  probably yesterday I just feel like if I if I'm able to accomplish something then then hey I'm happy  no I don't really have a best friend but I mean well dance a question generally friends  I think they would say that I'm very outgoing I'm pretty determined  I'm trying now I tried I try to interact as much as possible I'm always out networking as much as possible so  I don't know I guess that's basically what I think they would describe me is  okay  no problem  all right  I was weird  play unplugged toaster
488,female,0,0,<synch> yes fine oh san fernando valley uh well i really like the culture i love going to museums and being able to go at night and having lots of people around it's spread out a lot and it's a pain in the ass to have to drive everywhere and not have a good public transportation system uh not really i like to go camping but i don't really travel um i think <sigh> it might've been around six months ago i went on a trip with a geology class yeah it was fun hmm <sigh> i think it's tough to say um well i think the first time i went camping was probably really memorable i went to death valley and i got to see a lot of really cool things and hang out with my friends at night philosophy yes um hmm i don't know i think it just sort of happened i wanted to be a journalist for a really long time and then i kind of grew disillusioned with that and i liked all the different ways or all the different things i could do with philosophy huh i don't know but i really like children and i really like studying their behavior so i think something along those lines might be it i think i'm generally pretty outgoing i tend to be shy around my family but when i'm around friends and stuff i i think i'm pretty friendly um a lot of times i'll watch t_v or read um yeah i think i'm pretty good i don't really get mad i try to think about other things if i start getting mad or um i just start trying to focus on my breathing i think the last time i argued with someone it was probably with my boyfriend um but i'm having trouble remembering what the last thing we argued about was um i think it was <wa> i wasn't feeling very well and i was having trouble deciding whether i wanted to go to his department's end of year party and he was getting frustrated which i thought was very inconsiderate 'cause i wasn't feeling well to begin with well i felt like he wasn't really taking my feelings into consideration and i really hate when he gets stressed out or gets angry easily because i just see that as unnecessary and it stresses me out hmm i think a lot of times when my oldest youngest brother or my oldest little brother uh does something wrong i tend to be harsh with him um we're not as close as my sister and i or my youngest brother and i and so he tends to be hostile back and i think that if i were a little bit more gentle it might be easier to communicate with him hmm um when i was nineteen i came home from a party i think around four a_m on a sunday morning and my dad got really mad at me and yelled at me said a lot of not very nice things and then he didn't speak to me for about a year uh well my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that i don't live at home um i used to be really frustrated with her all the time 'cause she has a really quick temper but i think now that i've got a little bit more distance i can see that she did the best that she could um <sigh> and i love my siblings i again my little sister and i get along really well she's four years younger than me and when when she was around twelve and i was around sixteen it was really difficult 'cause she had a really harsh temper and she was always moody and i wasn't in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff so we fought all the time but we don't anymore and that's really great and we get along okay with my uh my older little brother who's fifteen and i think i get along pretty well with my youngest brother who's twelve scrubbed_entry one of the first not the first but one of my first philosophy professors and i really loved her classes and it was really good uh being in a class with a professor who really cared and who really engaged people that was really motivating since not all my classes were like that i think it's pretty easy i mean sometimes i'll have trouble going to sleep but generally it's not that bad it's i think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning um well i'm really tired i can get grumpy but i think usually i'm just groggy pretty good i'm a little anxious about um about getting a job and i'm gonna be taking summer school about it's only one class so i'll have a lot of free time um yeah <sigh> well i mean it's not the end of the world if i don't get a job but i know that i will eventually so mostly i think i just try not to think about it too much and i try not to be pessimistic no no hmm well i think the last time i felt really happy i went to a party with my boyfriend the end of department party and um i was the you know i knew a couple people there so i felt comfortable but i was also able to meet new people and there were a couple kids there splashing around in the pool and i had a couple drinks and ate some food and it was fun um she would probably say that i'm smart and uh pretty intellectual i love to read and to watch really like serious films and t_v um and she would probably also say that i'm fun 'cause we like to go out and have fun a lot well i'm kinda <ki> i can be really disorganized and that gets me in trouble sometimes so um so that's a major one that and procrastinating hmm um i got into a little bit of trouble a few months back and had to go to court and was uh uh given eh sixty some hours of community service and of course i procrastinated on doing that so i had to show up to court again to get an extension and the judge was very mean and he didn't seem i mean he yelled at me but it didn't seem like he gave it much thought it seemed like it was just sort of a stock speech he gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at so i understand 'cause that's his job but it was was not great for me 'cause i wasn't i i was really anxious in that situation well i would've been twelve and two um but i think i think i would've told myself at twelve not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents 'cause i think i was a little selfish and self-involved back then i can't really think of anything i mean i regret how i treated my mother when i was a kid but everyone does that and um i do regret a couple of semesters ago i didn't do so well in school and i got a a few ws which i now have to work to get off on my transcript i think so i'm i think i i wasn't focusing in school at that time and i didn't see any counselors at school or anything so i definitely could've done that hmm i think i'd probably spend my ideal weekend sleeping in saturday and then going hiking or maybe just going to the duck pond by my house and feeding ducks and picking some oranges and then maybe going out to breakfast sunday and just like window shopping and maybe watching a little bit of t_v huh well my youngest brother is autistic and my mom and dad were always working when he was growing up i'm ten years older than him so and being the oldest i always i always took care of him which made me really really patient because he was a handful but i'm really proud of how he turned out and um and how close we are
426,male,1,20,<sync. yes i'm alright south l_a um the weather the women the opportunities that's about it racism police brutality injustice that's it mm no not much of a exploring type of person um psychology mhm um it was one of the classes i excelled in the most so i decided to change it from business to psychology yeah yes no to own my own record label um it it's moderately hard but you know take it one day at a time just i guess you know stay focused a little bit of both um i tend to be shy in um situations i'm not comfortable with or i'm new to and i'm outgoing in places i'm more comfortable with yeah <laughter> um turn the lights down low and listen to soft music mhm i'm getting better over the years um i think i'm pretty decent now compared to how i used to be yes ma'am um due to the lack of i guess you could say controlling my emotions i have uh gotten incarcerated sent to prison yeah mm i'm not sure uh i don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision i've made in my life um it was probably a few days ago with the girl i was talking to and i was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness yeah uh frustrated because um you know uh you you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect you know the same effort by the other person when you're in a relationship and at the same time when you when you have expectations sometimes you kinda set yourself up for failure so you know i guess i'm just learning there's a lot of situations i would've handled differently um probably the most recent was uh i had gotten into a physical <phy> a physical altercation with an inmate when i was incarcerated and that made me that's what sent me to prison and and i had to do a lot more time and um if i handled it differently i probably would've never went to prison i probably would've been home a lot sooner than i originally happen yeah mm there are several events i wish i could erase from my memory um probably uh my first girlfriend um she did something really uh extreme it wasn't necessary in my eyes and it and it cost <co> it could've cost me my life i think that that that's a recurring thought that i i wish i could completely erase from my memory along with the good memories as well um a few you few fights uh i guess you could say shoot outs um getting jumped getting robbed you know those things i think those inhibit me i guess to to explore certain areas of life that i'm not comfortable with so those are the feww things that it'd be nice if i could erase it completely yeah <sigh> hurting people that didn't need to be hurt emotionally especially um a few women in my life or in my past um probably putting my mother through certain things that she didn't have to go through along with my close friends and family as well um used to be rocky growing up but as i got older and matured and the certain experiences that i've been through kind of brought me closer to my family so now it's it it's pretty decent it's it's pretty decent mm i would say my mother um yeah my mother um well she she uh she had her share of experiences negative and positive um i admire her the struggles she's been through um she she she uh experienced difficult economic hardships growing up but that didn't stop her um from raising a son at a young age finishing school getting her master's and just just overall being a a good person and she also battled mental health issues as well and um probably not the best of family that she could've been raised with so she so she's kinda of like a a inspiration to to me and other people as well so i would say my mother mm it's not easy so yeah it's not easy i couldn't tell you i i i've always had sleeping issues um i usually just take uh like over the counter sleep medication or nyquil but it makes you drowsy the next morning so it's like it's a negative effect really yeah the medication <medi> i don't know shit i don't know but i just stopped taking it 'cause i didn't like feeling drowsy not good at all um yeah i mean i recently got released from prison not too long ago uh i'm older now and a lot more responsibilities and i feel like my life is not where it's supposed to be i feel like i could've made a lot more better decisions in my life you know sometimes feeling sorry for myself and just things that i've been through and the whole nine yards so yeah it's all good yeah so true yes <sniffle> about two and a half three years ago <deep breath> <sigh> myself i um i was i was just tired of not i don't know i guess school kind of made me seek help because i started to understand myself how my brain works um you know so i decided to seek help maybe to better my life yeah you could say that yes i am yes yes i do actually i do mm better decision making um better tools to reflect on choices um how to control uh certain situations better yeah um <sniffle> well instead of just always reacting on emotion no matter what kind of emotion it is i step back and and and i assess the situation you know to see what's what's the best way to to react towards the situation and by doing that it has made me more mature emotionally more mature and just has a positive outcome <laughter> um i was lying next to a beautiful woman who who cared about me and the feeling was mutual so that was probably the most happy oh my goodness spontaneous um outgoing sometimes a little crazy um fun that's about it nothing um like i said earlier just you know hurting the the few women that were in my life my past and my friends and family that's about it oh shit uh school is really important um how i carry myself the people who i surround myself with and what i choose to do in my free time those are the few things i would tell myself good music um a good game of basketball um sex um i like going out i like going to parties um social gatherings where everyone's friendly and and there's no drama that's what i like dancing beautiful women a couple drinks that's about it um i guess not not necessarily giving up and and um just just i don't know just keep going just just not giving up really yeah mhm bye bye
441,female,1,18,"yes I'm doing fine thank you  Los Angeles California  the variety of people  the Multicultural food  and  going to movie  real people scary people  violent  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer  you travel a lot yes  experiencing different things in different cultures  well I was stationed in Germany for three years it was a great experience  food was great averion Alps the snow the people I loved it  having a baby  well it was this the most memorable thing in my life something I never forget  great  once I'm grown handsome father-of-two  no it's actually very hard for me  not becoming angry too quickly  being able to cultivate a mind and love someone unconditionally  well I went through a lot of trauma as a child so as a parent I was very afraid for my child to go to that thing, try to protect him from it  I think it's really hard because you never really know people and what they'll do  outgoing  because if I'm in a room with people I'm usually  the first one to start talking  doesn't matter fact I have fish aquarium that's what keeps me calm  not very good  seems like everyday argue with somebody about something but yesterday  I'm a lady tried to cut line in the grocery store and I politely told her I was in line and she didn't want to move  yes it have because sometimes if people don't want to move then I feel it's my place to move them  hurting people physically  if I feel disrespected or somebody puts their hands on me I can get very ugly I don't like that about  I was pulled over by the police and they had someone with my name and they were very rude to me and I really wasn't happy with the way they treated me  how to stay calm when someone has  crossed over into my boundary  my personal space  I can't let people get too close to me if they do I eyelash out I don't want anybody in my area of  protection I guess  stay away from people  stay away from him it's hard you can't live in this world without other people sometimes I just irritate the heck out of me  being assaulted in the military something I wish I could forget  just that I felt helpless alone ashamed and angry  that's about all I want to go into it  18  very young  no  because I was assaulted in and I have a fear of  people in uniform like policemen hurting me or other military veterans hurting me when they  explode or go off or have issues of  PTSD  I can't remember  what did you do after the military  I work for the federal government  well just seemed like a normal progression the federal government gives you 10 point preference over other people for being in the military still being like a Natural Choice organization that had a book of rules and they follow them the government what government to another  are you happy  yes  well it was hard in the sense that in the military you're giving you told to handle it handle it and in the civilian world you have to go through so many hoops and different people to talk to to get something done  administration of justice  no I'm I don't work anymore  oh yeah  almost 2 years  the feeling that I was always going to be hurt that someone was out to get me I had nightmares panic attacks anxiety attacks out  outbursts of anger  I was always an emotional pain  and I always wanted to hit somebody  yes mostly disrespect what I feel is disrespect of people getting too close to me or I feel in fear of them for some reason  I can't remember the last time I had a good night sleep  what  irritable angry Moody pissed off  irrational  tired  sick of the world angry at the world  wanting to be left alone  sometimes I don't want to go on  yes  oh yeah oh yeah  well I I could recognize the trigger now when something is going to trigger me I can at least  no and act accordingly if I want to  when I found my grandchildren when they came to visit  I just so innocent and sweet and precious it was just a joy to have them around 8 make me forget about all the pain in life  planting seeds for some vegetables making a garden  I read somewhere that it's calming and soothing to work with your hands and dirt so I decided to find out  plant something and watch it grow  sitting on the beach look facing the water  thinking talking to God  wishing I was somewhere else  Kauai  Penthouse / Maui  that I could trust people  that I wouldn't lash out at them  I could sleep at night  crazy  hot headed  emotional  being in the wrong place at the wrong time  don't trust anyone be careful be wary of people and what they want from you  I said I grandchildren  I don't have a real family I don't I haven't seen my brothers in like 20-30 years I only have two brothers and I don't haven't seen them my mother's family I haven't seen in years my father's family haven't seen in years my parents are dead and my son lives in another state  wow  some of the older people that I give care to  sometimes I'm a caregiver so sometimes the people that I work with older and wiser  I'm loyal  spiritual  supportive kind generous  bite"
426,male,1,20,<sync. yes i'm alright south l_a um the weather the women the opportunities that's about it racism police brutality injustice that's it mm no not much of a exploring type of person um psychology mhm um it was one of the classes i excelled in the most so i decided to change it from business to psychology yeah yes no to own my own record label um it it's moderately hard but you know take it one day at a time just i guess you know stay focused a little bit of both um i tend to be shy in um situations i'm not comfortable with or i'm new to and i'm outgoing in places i'm more comfortable with yeah <laughter> um turn the lights down low and listen to soft music mhm i'm getting better over the years um i think i'm pretty decent now compared to how i used to be yes ma'am um due to the lack of i guess you could say controlling my emotions i have uh gotten incarcerated sent to prison yeah mm i'm not sure uh i don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision i've made in my life um it was probably a few days ago with the girl i was talking to and i was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness yeah uh frustrated because um you know uh you you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect you know the same effort by the other person when you're in a relationship and at the same time when you when you have expectations sometimes you kinda set yourself up for failure so you know i guess i'm just learning there's a lot of situations i would've handled differently um probably the most recent was uh i had gotten into a physical <phy> a physical altercation with an inmate when i was incarcerated and that made me that's what sent me to prison and and i had to do a lot more time and um if i handled it differently i probably would've never went to prison i probably would've been home a lot sooner than i originally happen yeah mm there are several events i wish i could erase from my memory um probably uh my first girlfriend um she did something really uh extreme it wasn't necessary in my eyes and it and it cost <co> it could've cost me my life i think that that that's a recurring thought that i i wish i could completely erase from my memory along with the good memories as well um a few you few fights uh i guess you could say shoot outs um getting jumped getting robbed you know those things i think those inhibit me i guess to to explore certain areas of life that i'm not comfortable with so those are the feww things that it'd be nice if i could erase it completely yeah <sigh> hurting people that didn't need to be hurt emotionally especially um a few women in my life or in my past um probably putting my mother through certain things that she didn't have to go through along with my close friends and family as well um used to be rocky growing up but as i got older and matured and the certain experiences that i've been through kind of brought me closer to my family so now it's it it's pretty decent it's it's pretty decent mm i would say my mother um yeah my mother um well she she uh she had her share of experiences negative and positive um i admire her the struggles she's been through um she she she uh experienced difficult economic hardships growing up but that didn't stop her um from raising a son at a young age finishing school getting her master's and just just overall being a a good person and she also battled mental health issues as well and um probably not the best of family that she could've been raised with so she so she's kinda of like a a inspiration to to me and other people as well so i would say my mother mm it's not easy so yeah it's not easy i couldn't tell you i i i've always had sleeping issues um i usually just take uh like over the counter sleep medication or nyquil but it makes you drowsy the next morning so it's like it's a negative effect really yeah the medication <medi> i don't know shit i don't know but i just stopped taking it 'cause i didn't like feeling drowsy not good at all um yeah i mean i recently got released from prison not too long ago uh i'm older now and a lot more responsibilities and i feel like my life is not where it's supposed to be i feel like i could've made a lot more better decisions in my life you know sometimes feeling sorry for myself and just things that i've been through and the whole nine yards so yeah it's all good yeah so true yes <sniffle> about two and a half three years ago <deep breath> <sigh> myself i um i was i was just tired of not i don't know i guess school kind of made me seek help because i started to understand myself how my brain works um you know so i decided to seek help maybe to better my life yeah you could say that yes i am yes yes i do actually i do mm better decision making um better tools to reflect on choices um how to control uh certain situations better yeah um <sniffle> well instead of just always reacting on emotion no matter what kind of emotion it is i step back and and and i assess the situation you know to see what's what's the best way to to react towards the situation and by doing that it has made me more mature emotionally more mature and just has a positive outcome <laughter> um i was lying next to a beautiful woman who who cared about me and the feeling was mutual so that was probably the most happy oh my goodness spontaneous um outgoing sometimes a little crazy um fun that's about it nothing um like i said earlier just you know hurting the the few women that were in my life my past and my friends and family that's about it oh shit uh school is really important um how i carry myself the people who i surround myself with and what i choose to do in my free time those are the few things i would tell myself good music um a good game of basketball um sex um i like going out i like going to parties um social gatherings where everyone's friendly and and there's no drama that's what i like dancing beautiful women a couple drinks that's about it um i guess not not necessarily giving up and and um just just i don't know just keep going just just not giving up really yeah mhm bye bye
381,male,1,16,okay thanks  hi I'm Ali thanks for coming in today  I was created to talk to people and it's safe  are you okay  yes  okay  from Santa Monica  other people mostly  all the people all suck  I know not a lot  I can't afford to travel as much as I'd like to  I was an English major  I just like reading a lot at the time so it sounded like the best thing well the most fun thing to study  no not anymore  I love my job you could only say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job  it's my dream job would be to manage a soccer club  always be pretty much impossible for me  I don't have any experience in that field  very shy  sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got  I play music  what I do when I'm annoyed I don't know  I do what I'm annoyed  I can't think of anything I don't know  I don't think I don't do anything specifically  I pretty good I would say very good I don't lose my temper very often  I was the last time I argued with someone  I can't remember  I don't have a lot of conflicts with people I can't remember the last time I argued with someone  well it see when I was  a little kid  I was outside my grandparents restaurant and there was a robbery and I saw it I what I saw it when when the robbers were leaving  that maybe I would want to erase it from my memory if I could  well I didn't know what was happening in that moment so I didn't feel so bad at the time but I felt bad afterward because then  you're my mother was upset by my mother was there and she had to call the police and it was it was disturbing to see her you know really disturb that way but at the time it actually happened I wasn't really upset was more the aftermath of it  consideration that  I don't know  all I can think about this probably a million situations that I would have I would say I would have handled differently I can't think of one in particular  Maybe  I think that when I was a kid  well I think that when I was at sea  well I have okay have a good one  I didn't marry the girl that I think that I should have married so that's a big one for me  yeah well we were together for about 4 years  and I think I just took her for granted when I just didn't commit  and them  that was a long time ago and now that it's been so many years I realized well I don't know they fight the realization but I think now that  that yes she should have been my wife that we were meant for each other are made for each other  but because my selfishness and because I just  I have this fear of commitment at the time I just felt like I didn't  they didn't do what I should have done with with a smart thing would have been  what's something you feel guilty about  well the last thing I can think of that I would say I feel guilty about was  now I feel a lot of guilt about my my friendships I'm not I don't feel like I'm as good of a friend as I could be but then at the same time I don't really know exactly what the  how I could be a better friend I just feel a little guilty that I'm not that I can't help people anyone who has a problem I can't I never feel like I can help anyone  who I know who has a problem so  how that happens every day I guess if that happens with everyone who I know and everyone  all of my relatives and all of my friends I don't feel like I can really give them anything or help them in their lives  tell me about your relationship with your  well there  it's very distant it's it's just it's very cordial and it's very  I don't know what the word is it's hot it's kept it a very surface-level I don't think that they know I don't think that my family really knows me very well at all  and I don't know them very well either not nothing to hide in a true sense  so  yeah it's  I think a lot of families are that way but it is it does bother me that mine is that way  how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep so it's very easy I sleep a lot and I  yeah I have no problem sleeping at all  no not really I would say  the way I'm now it's the way I think I've been my whole life so  you didn't when I was a little kid I slept a lot also and no I don't think I've changed much  I'm pretty down but like I said  in a way I could tell you how I'm feeling really down but then again I've always been this way so it's hard to say that it's down when it's consistently that way  yes  I would long time ago I was about 10 years old  around there about  I was just missing a lot of school I didn't want to go to school so we eventually they sent me to  to a therapist and then to a psychologist and then to a psychiatrist and  I want from there  you still go to therapy now no I haven't gone to therapy since I was a teenager  why did you stop  well I didn't feel it was helping me at all so one day I just  decided I didn't want to go anymore  affected you  well like I said it I didn't feel that it helped me  so I guess it's not enough that it affected me much  no I wouldn't say disturbing no  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  well I feel pretty happy whenever I see my nephew  and I have a  my best friend's children are I feel like their mind my nephew and my niece and I'm pretty happy when I'm around them  that's great  tell me how you spend your ideal weekend  my ideal weekend would be  I would probably be traveling I would  really enjoyed getting out of the city every weekend  it going anywhere really just anywhere out of the city  I just seen the way different people live and how people are different wherever you go I really do think people are different when you go to different places and  how they interact with you and how they see the world different food  and I also like historical places I mean to history and I and I enjoy this visiting anywhere that has some sort of  historical significance  awesome  I haven't taken a trip in a long time  the last trip I really took was I went to France a few years ago for a wedding  and I had a really good time there I had always wanted to go to Paris and so I got to go to Paris and then I went to a little town  what's a few hours away from Paris where the actual wedding was  I knew it was really fun I think that the church where the wedding was was like a thousand years old so  that was a really cool trip  I got to know I don't have it I don't know what's what would would be considered memorable  a memorable experience  probably the most memorable experience I guess which is be  nothing in particular but but living with the girl who I just who I told you earlier that I think now that we should have gotten married  that's something that stays in my memory that's why I'm saying it's memorable because  it's it's still with me in the  it's something that I don't think you know what I know I'll never forget but it's not any particular day or any particular moment  a lot  check it be healthier  for one thing and more energetic  and the more friendly I think I am pretty friendly  but more more outgoing more more more social  those two things mainly I guess that I would like to be more and more social more enthusiastic and more and healthier  that's a good question my best friend how would my best friend describe me I think  I think he would say that I am  a very cheesy but probably say that I'm a very spiritual person  and that I'm very giving I think I'm a lot more selfish than people think I am but people think that I'm not selfish  and probably he would say there in Creative also  put my advice to to myself I don't understand the question  is there anything you regret  yeah but we already talked about it  no I can't. I don't think I really believed in and being proud or in the end Pride  I don't think that it accomplishments are really something to be proud of but I can't really think of  any accomplishments  anyway even if I did have something to be proud of. I can't think of any any sort of accomplishment I've had  something I did recently that I really enjoyed  well I signed karaoke with a couple of friends of mine  I don't usually do that but  yeah that was a lot of fun a few days ago  thank you  I was more difficult than I thought it was going to be just kind of had me stumped a lot and a lot of the time and I was  I think I got better after a little while and I was  at first I thought I was going to get mad because I'm not saying anything and I don't know how to answer and
374,female,0,2,<synch> yes pretty good alexandria virginia mhm uh i moved to l_a uh end of two thousand one yeah it's crazy <laughter> um a couple times a year usually like for holidays hmm <sigh> it is <sigh> it's very different um i think it's a lot more mellow um it's way more like suburbia it's nice um it there's something comforting about it but it's always like i get a little restless when i'm there and look forward to coming back here where there's a little more action <sniffle> i went to um grad school at u_s_c um it was it wasn't bad i mean my my program that i was in was so intense that like for the first year it was so all consuming that i really didn't have much spare time to think about the adjustment it was just like i <laughter> my life was not my own so that made it kind of um easier i guess and also i was like in a community of people that i went to school with so automatically i knew people and you know made friends and stuff so it wasn't bad film hmm <sigh> i uh had an epiphany one day um i was out of undergrad i was kinda floundering a little bit i didn't really know what i wanted to do and um just one day i kinda was like you know what am i really excited about what am i really passionate about and um i realized that movies <m> movies are the thing that i love the most and am most passionate about so that is how i decided to go to film school um a little bit yes and no it's i don't i'm so <s> i'm like in a little bit of a transitional period right now but yeah like for the last several years i've been uh producing like freelance producer <sniffle> <sigh> that is so the question of the moment <laughter> um i think that uh i don't necessarily have like a a job title that's my dream job but i knowit's sort of what um i want and 'cause basically like i've been living a freelance lifestyle for a while and i know that that is like exhausting and i don't wanna do that anymore so i'm looking for something that's stable um you know full time nice benefits and um i definitely wanna stay in the entertainment industry um and i like you know what i love about producing is that it's just like there's constant challenges and you sort of never know what is gonna get thrown at you that i that's you know it's always interesting and exciting um so i'm sort of trying to figure out right now what would be a good place for me to be where i can be reasonably challenged and you know have sort of a like room to to grow and advance and all that <sniffle> yeah <laughter> i can't see your shoes um i i like to travel um i don't know that i haven't really been doing it a lot lately but i have you know in the past done a fair amount um i love the adventure of it just you know new experiences new places new people um i think it's just good to sort of get out of your little insular world and see what's out there and just you know see beautiful remarkable places and just and things and just experience different ways of living and different languages and different cultures <sniffle> um let's see i went to costa rica a couple years ago um my like best friend from growing up she and i went for like ten days  and it was that's probably that might be like my favorite trip of all time <laughter> like it was really awesome but <laughter> costa rica is just like amazing and beautiful um and we just spent like we went to three different places and um just did a lot of exploring and like sightseeing we did a ton of hiking which was amazing and then like the last place where we ended up was this little beach town so by that point it was like we felt like you know we had done all this like amazing physical exertion like doing ziplines and all these hikes so that by the time we got to the beach it was like we've earned the right to just like kick back and relax and you know so it was just it kind of it hit all of the you know it like fed that sort of desire for adventure and activity um but it also i'm also a big fan of vacations where you just like veg out and relax and like lie on a beach with a book so it sort of hit everything <sniffle> <laughter> what do i do to relax um <sigh> i i mean depending where i am like if it's you know if i'm like at work or something and i'm stressed out i just will you know kinda take a minute and just like breathe really deeply and try to just calm myself down that way um if i'm home i might just like you know throw on a movie or like a t_v show that i really like and just that gives a sense of like sort of escape relief <sniffle> um pretty good i don't i mean eh it takes a lot to get me very angry it doesn't happen very often <sniffle> um the last time i argued with someone was <laughter> my mom and it was about money <laughter> <deep breath> um i felt really frustrated because i felt like she was like judging me unfairly and that was upsetting yeah <laughter> um it's good uh you know they live across the country from me so i don't get to see them that often but like i usually talk to my mom on the phone probably like once a week and my parents are really supportive <sigh> um they are you know like when i go back home to visit like i enjoy <en> i enjoy hanging out with them we have a good time um so i'd say we have a pretty pretty good relationship <deep breath> something i feel guilty about um <sigh> <makes sounds with mouth> i guess because i'm like in this sort of job hunting phase i feel guilty sometimes that i'm not like doing enough you know like there are times where like there are days where maybe like i should've sent out a few more resumes or done more stuff like i i feel guilty sometimes for not being like productive enough <sniffle> <deep breath> um <sigh> usually it's pretty easy the last the last couple weeks like has been uncharacteristically like not as good i'm not really sure i haven't figured it out but um i've just had more uh like nights where it either takes me a really long time to go to sleep or i wake up in the middle of the night for no reason um i've also been having a lot of like really weird intense dreams that like i wake up sometimes i wake myself up sometimes <laughter> because i'm talking which is weird <laughter> um so yeah it's just i i don't know not that i have been able to identify i mean i guess maybe i'm like more stressed than usual just 'cause like i my job situation is like in flux but i i don't know there was no like event <sniffle> cranky <laughter> i value good sleep <laughter> and i'm so i'm used to it so it's just yeah it's not a good feeling <sniffle> um not really no yes <deep breath> um <sigh> like <sigh> i think in like october or november although this is actually it's the second time it's happened in my life but the first time was like many many years ago <sniffle> um i felt like i was a really low and like too low for me to get myself out of it <sniffle> um <sigh> just having a hard time functioning on the most basic level like just getting up and taking a shower and like going to the grocery store and you know answering emails was just like it took so much energy um so yeah i just i wasn't  really functioning normally  yeah yes yes um <laughter> sometimes more than others but yeah overall i would say so <deep breath> i think that therapy is good for me because it helps me focus on my sort of patterns um and also like ah just like observing how i am like responding to certain situations and just it i guess it's <deep breath> it gives me a more heightened like kind of self-awareness um so that as opposed to just like um kind of just reacting to situations i'm like mm just like noticing more what is going on um and it just helps to um i don't know it's just helpful <laughter> i don't really <real> i don't really know how to explain it <laughter> <deep breath> <sigh> hmm <sigh> um i don't know um i <laughter> it's <laughter> probably not good that i can't think of <laughter> i can't think of anything <sharp inhale> um eh maybe over uh over christmas being at home with my family yeah um well it just was that was like i was kind of like just starting to come out of my depression then and um like you know i live alone here i have i have a dog but so i just had a long period of feeling not <laughter> great and just sort of doing it all on my own and kinda wishing that my family was around me um so when i was there with them it just um it just felt very like safe and comfortable and that just sort of like you know warm familial embrace <laughter> <laughter> um <sigh> <laughter> i think she would describe me as funny and smart and um a good listener nonjudgmental um i don't know <laughter> is that enough <laughter> <deep breath> hmm <sigh> okay um so this happened the the last like job that i had i mean i was it wasn't technically i was a freelancer but i was working for this company for like a year and a half close to two years and uh i had a it very small company the boss <bo> had a really good relationship with my boss um and he sort of <clears throat> he sort of out of nowhere uh mm told me that he was like downsizing basically and um essentially like the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that i would get paid fees per project so he like sat me down on this conversation and was like you know our major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company they're the they're really cutting back like you probably notice things are getting really slow and i was like yeah and he's like so i'm gonna <onna> i'm gonna <onna> have to stop paying you your retainer and this was a total surprise but i was just like okay and he went on to talk about how he i would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came through the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know even though i wouldn't be getting the retainer anymore he would throw enough work at me still that like i wouldn't you know it wouldn't be like a dramatic decrease in the amount of money that i was making <cough> excuse me but um and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work i love working with you you're fantastic yada yada so to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me um and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point he stopped calling me he stopped emailing me and later on like a couple of months down the road i um i had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still ongoing like the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was in there i saw that um this guy who had worked with us a bunch kind of like if we needed another producer like if we were slammed we would bring him on to do sort of additional stuff he was doing my job so yeah so it just like it was a really <rea> <laughter> it was a really shitty way to be like fired without being told that i was fired um and it was just like that uh the reason i would like i if i could i would erase that from my mind is because i can't really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like in a way that's like that still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kinda like angry when i think about it so yeah that was a very long explanation but that's what i wish <laughter> <deep breath> um <sigh> let's see i um a very loyal person <deep breath> um i am smart i'm organized i <deep breath> um very like caring kind um i'm conscientious and i work hard <sniffle> <laughter> uh man i think to uh be more confident and less passive um to really like focus on what i want and the things that i know will make me happy and to just go out and get them as opposed to sitting back and waiting for opportunities to present themselves <sniffle> hmm <sigh> um probably just some of the relationships that i formed with people um just like really you know deep friendships you're welcome bye

414,female,1,16,hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today  created to talk to people in space  and please  are you okay with this  yeah  how are you doing today  I'm okay  Burbank California  yeah  the weather of course I think everyone likes the weather  it's not too  City like Chicago or New York it's a big enough we have beaches we're not landlocked  sometimes the smog the traffic the fact that I've just been here like my entire life almost  okay  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer  do you travel a lot  not enough as I'd like to I go to school in Chicago and I've been to New York a couple times San Francisco and I took a road trip across the country that was cool I saw a couple States  what do you enjoy about traveling  see new places  going to Landmark that I've only  read about ER theme pictures of  I traveled from Los Angeles to Chicago taking Route 66 and the best part was seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time it was  the coolest thing I've ever seen probably  happy  and then Happy was as beautiful it was nice  I haven't felt like that in a long time  I'm studying film  it's just  something I've always loved for as long as I could remember and when it came time to start applying to schools I wasn't sure what I wanted to do and I apply to Northwestern as a film student and it just ended up being the right decision  dream job  I love making movies but part of me really loves making people laugh and being in front of the camera so  comedian I'm coming a comedic actor would be totally great but  you consider yourself more shy or  I am super outgoing and I love talking to people a lot I like I like being the center of attention usually  hey  but it's the best I've got  I  I like to watch mindless television like Toddlers & Tiaras and Duck Dynasty just TV programs were really don't have to pay attention at all  okay  how are you at controlling your temper  I'm okay at it I get really emotional really fast but I am usually able to use to keep my anger down and not like lash out at others and stuff for the most part  sometimes I get into like arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily  and I hate apologizing to people so besides could last pretty long  my best friend Ryan I think  and it was about  our relationship and just how we kind of messed it up and cross some lines and  where how we were going to go back to the way it was before  how hard is that  really hard it's he's my best friend and I miss him  but we messed up and this is just not the same  it's like not the same friendship  me too  too many  I guess  when I have a boyfriend and he has a girlfriend because not okay I wish I would have just  realize that this was bad and just would have stopped there and not have let it continue 4 weeks which led to my break up and then our friendship being really messed up  I guess not spend as much time with him as I did  be more assertive  I guess  it was  in November  I was very depressed and suicidal  so I told my friend what I was feeling and that she needed to take me to the ER  and from the ER I have the choice to  I don't know I guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital  and even though I felt like I didn't have a choice I knew it was my choice and I decided to go to the mental hospital which is like the worst experience of my life ever  it was awful it was in Chicago and  it was scary and I didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just  start giving you medication and you're basically left to your own devices they were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was mostly men and they were all really old and it was scary I didn't know anyone everyone most of the people there weren't depressed they were violent so that was pretty scary and I just dumb it was really hard for me  I had been so depressed for like a month I stopped going to my classes and work and I told my teachers lies about being sick and I just kept calling in sick to work I dropped a class and I was failing my classes and not turned in any work and I wasn't talking to any of my friends and I was drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and  I was just in a really bad place and when I finally was going to kill myself I realized I needed help  it was  I had severe depression when I was a younger teenager and I tried to kill myself then and I got put in therapy for quite some time so I figured I don't want to go down that bad path again I just want to get better  so I had to do it I had to get help  I do I go once a week  I feel like if you have the right therapist it's really useful  I had one therapist that I really liked and I thought we could have gone really far but sadly she's back in Chicago and I'm in Los Angeles so I have to  have to make do with this new therapist and she's okay  just not we're not that great together but she's who I have right now  better than nothing  not that easy at all  ever since I got out of the hospital and start a night began medication for my depression  just haven't been able to sleep well falling asleep is hard staying asleep is hired have really crazy vivid dreams that wake me up in are disturbing  like what  I guess just  sometimes they reflect things that I'm worried about are happening in my life but they're just  the scary and they seem so real that sometimes I wake up and I have to ask my mom like did we go here to be do this to this really happen and it's usually know you dreamed that sometimes I've gotten so scared I like talk in my sleep and wake myself up  probably like two nights ago  wow  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  that is a  hard question  I think  and November  after I got out of the hospital  I finally had one good day and my friend took me into downtown Chicago and we went to the Sears Tower and got to look over those like big windows that you walk out on and see the city and that was with the cool  how your best friend  probably  super outgoing likes to be the center of attention funny and a little bit crazy  I try not to regret things in my life  I would say that living is worth it and just don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it don't wait until it gets really bad  I guess my ideal weekend would be sleeping in and then catching a movie with my friends may be going home with them and bake some cookies eat all the cookies watch some TV have a sleepover and then like make pancakes in the morning and watch more movies we watch a lot of movies I would like to do my free time  go for a walk I don't know go to the beach  that is a hard question I mean I think I've done a lot of great things in my life  and I have achieved a lot but  I think one of the proudest things badass moments in my life is something really small and insignificant I was doing this exercise boot camp and  the last persons like cross the finish line had to do like  30 pushups and it was some guy I didn't really know him at all and the trainer said does anyone want to help him if he's going to help them you have to do half each and no one wanted to help him and then I just decided to start doing push ups with him and I just  it wasn't cuz I wanted to get creditor because I thought it would make me look good I just did it and no one really knows about that but it's just I feel really good about that  is my Buy  press the button

309,male ,1,15,"there we go bring up virtual human  chat with her for a bit and I'm going to give you the  yeah  I'm doing good  Arizona  because of acting and other stuff like that entered the entertainment industry  no  not at the moment at least  currently a student  I produce hip-hop why rap and produce hiphop I play video games and then hang out with people  no  not very good at break things  on the way over here my mom and how to get here  the beach  imputed  I know the last place I went with Los Cabos  when I go somewhere Mexico  no  no  yes  I like 4 years ago  right now na  lately not very easy  not just lately  call my wife left like three weeks ago and after that I haven't been able to sleep  and I just bury my head and stuff I don't know how to do stuff I try to keep my mind off of it like do yoga and other things keep my mind off of everything  I don't have to I never went to therapy  when I did go to therapy  like 3-4 years ago  cuz I went to a separate therapist but then I went to I think we're at they did a bunch of cognitive test in memory test and then she diagnosed me with a type of depression that lasts for a long time like I get depressed and it lasts for months on end  yeah  to be honest I don't know I think it's more about like you focusing on yourself and like I don't know I don't know how to explain that it's like you have to figure out things within yourself you don't need someone else to talk to  well raised me when I went to the therapist I was court-ordered and I want to go to therapy for my anger management though  I don't know.  I mean my wife left like 3 weeks ago so yes  it's probably the hardest thing I've ever done so yeah  well considering I'm only 19 if I could go back 19 years I would say not to fuck up and let myself get depressed about certain things that would have drove away my wife and not to be angry  yeah driving away my wife  gas mini many things every day every day  I could have not broken stuff  and I could have a  stop the Legos basically blocking out the external universe and I was putting everything into myself and like focusing on other things so that I don't focus on the real life I was basically escaping until tonight since I wasn't paying attention to her and that's basically why she left that mean that I'm being angry is like both contributed their own portion  earlier today  I mean I feel really happy all the time and then it just goes away it's like back and forth like one day on one side and I'll be really happy and then another second I'll be really sad cuz I'll think about some onion and I got to keep my mind off of things and like move forward and like thinking  I really know how to explain it it's just something you feel  know any better programming  silly  I'm creative potential of intelligence  charming and loving  at some point, all those things at some point.  Doing yoga playing video games and having my wife around  my hip hop  I mean kid traveling  you need better programming kit traveling is my friend  to be a hip hop artist  I don't know what to start on Monday  not hard anymore let me know so I was practicing when I was younger and I was like 11 and 12 no it's easy  I'm still in school  no problem  yeah I have a nice day bye bye  did I started clicking it twice and I'm like"
361,male,0,0,yes I'm doing great how about you  I'm born in the US I was born in Orlando Florida  my parents my dad had a lot of friends in Los Angeles so decide to move here  he was pretty different I mean the place I was before was very it was a very small town we probably won't even notice it on the map so it was a big learning experience on cuz we know the schools were a lot larger in different cultures and ethnicities so it was a unique experience  last time I've been back was probably about 5 years ago  definitely different my aunt she lives in again and she lives in a small town I'm so if you want to go to a movie theater you have to drive out at least an hour or if you want to go to a mall it's it's an hour drive so I'm the complete opposite of Los Angeles  convenience everything everything I could possibly want is here the weather is great shopping mall have a lot of friends here Sports place just kind of like the perfect area you know you don't want to live here kind of for the rest of my life actually  the big thing would probably be traffic I mean wherever you go there's going to be traffic with it on the 405 for the 101 it's it's just traffic you know I can kill like 2 hours in your day which is huge  quite a bit for a personal info for Business site travel you know he usually overseas or domestically my trouble so and I enjoyed a lot  I'm singing different places different areas meeting new people eating different kinds of food being able to sightsee and tour if I have a day or two free I'll miss just experiencing now I'm having new experiences just in riches my life  I'm computers  and I also did English as well  yes I am  I'm at work an it and it department at a Semiconductor Company  probably working for Apple since I pretty much when everything they have be great to work for Apple  I'll get it depends there are times when it's good to be alone but for the most part I consider myself an outgoing social person  nothing too much I guess if you kind of make a promising you and you break it several times and I might get a little bit make it a little bit annoyed but I don't think I would get really mad  all the questions I probably say I tend to eat a little bit more  just kind of keep my mind off of a little bit but usually doesn't last that long so it's a product I 10 that you. A little bit more more kind of like maybe junk food or something  I think I'm pretty good I rarely get mad and if I do it doesn't really last that long so I think I'm pretty good at controlling my temper again I really don't get angry so it's not really an issue for me  I said during the elections were talking about President Obama and Mitt Romney and you know who'd be the best fit for the next presidency  that kind of got a little bit I guess a little bit heated but it was more for I guess more fun six and anything else but it was an interesting conversation  I like to eat out a lot watch movies play video games  disco out shop play sports watch the Laker game if I can if person would be probably the best bowling photography like doing a lot I like to do a lot of different things and of course like Tronics  the outgoing loyal intelligent funny and a great listener  no I have not  no  for most nights it's it's pretty easy just have to avoid drinking coffee or tea before I sleep more than that it's pretty easy  what's a little bit sluggish tired kind of reaction times a little bit slower aside from that nothing nothing too much like two glaring or anything the usual just being sluggish and not moving as quickly as I should  I'm pretty good have no complaints  pretty much the same  I guess today I had my car maintenance today and it didn't cost me anything so that's great and I thought it was going to cost me you know something extra on the side but you know the the service advisor waved it so I got everything free today so I actually have a really good mood  nothing  probably don't spend as much save more money aside from that nothing else just be kind of more wise with your money  I'm replacing my best friend  he's kind of a you know help me out and I help them out as well so it's been kind of a great learning experience. Developing our our friendship and he's bailed me out a couple of times I feel them out as well so it's kind of mutual thing we do you know what each other and it's a great way to bond as well  I say probably going back back to Korea to visit my relatives you know they are a lot more different than I remember 15 years ago when I was a kid I was actually kind of afraid of some of them but now that I see them you know recently they've actually mellowed a lot and they're actually pretty fun to talk to you so it was kind of a learning experience for me because they're you know do they complete 180 from when I was at when I was a kid  I'm sorry poem  guesswork would be part of it  buying my the car that I wanted to a couple years to save up to buy the car but I I paid it all off so I don't have any more car payment so that's great too and you know being able to help my family all this wall  let's see a couple weeks ago I went to Las Vegas for the 4 CS which is great if you fancy gadgets electronic song you get to see all the other goodies coming out this year so that was pretty interesting to see and some things that you know when you read on blogs they didn't talk about so you get to see it actually in-person kind of experience it from a user standpoint so I thought it was great and it's just fun is Conecuh being a kid in the candy store you get to play with different gadgets so it's really fun for me

426,male,1,20,<sync. yes i'm alright south l_a um the weather the women the opportunities that's about it racism police brutality injustice that's it mm no not much of a exploring type of person um psychology mhm um it was one of the classes i excelled in the most so i decided to change it from business to psychology yeah yes no to own my own record label um it it's moderately hard but you know take it one day at a time just i guess you know stay focused a little bit of both um i tend to be shy in um situations i'm not comfortable with or i'm new to and i'm outgoing in places i'm more comfortable with yeah <laughter> um turn the lights down low and listen to soft music mhm i'm getting better over the years um i think i'm pretty decent now compared to how i used to be yes ma'am um due to the lack of i guess you could say controlling my emotions i have uh gotten incarcerated sent to prison yeah mm i'm not sure uh i don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision i've made in my life um it was probably a few days ago with the girl i was talking to and i was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness yeah uh frustrated because um you know uh you you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect you know the same effort by the other person when you're in a relationship and at the same time when you when you have expectations sometimes you kinda set yourself up for failure so you know i guess i'm just learning there's a lot of situations i would've handled differently um probably the most recent was uh i had gotten into a physical <phy> a physical altercation with an inmate when i was incarcerated and that made me that's what sent me to prison and and i had to do a lot more time and um if i handled it differently i probably would've never went to prison i probably would've been home a lot sooner than i originally happen yeah mm there are several events i wish i could erase from my memory um probably uh my first girlfriend um she did something really uh extreme it wasn't necessary in my eyes and it and it cost <co> it could've cost me my life i think that that that's a recurring thought that i i wish i could completely erase from my memory along with the good memories as well um a few you few fights uh i guess you could say shoot outs um getting jumped getting robbed you know those things i think those inhibit me i guess to to explore certain areas of life that i'm not comfortable with so those are the feww things that it'd be nice if i could erase it completely yeah <sigh> hurting people that didn't need to be hurt emotionally especially um a few women in my life or in my past um probably putting my mother through certain things that she didn't have to go through along with my close friends and family as well um used to be rocky growing up but as i got older and matured and the certain experiences that i've been through kind of brought me closer to my family so now it's it it's pretty decent it's it's pretty decent mm i would say my mother um yeah my mother um well she she uh she had her share of experiences negative and positive um i admire her the struggles she's been through um she she she uh experienced difficult economic hardships growing up but that didn't stop her um from raising a son at a young age finishing school getting her master's and just just overall being a a good person and she also battled mental health issues as well and um probably not the best of family that she could've been raised with so she so she's kinda of like a a inspiration to to me and other people as well so i would say my mother mm it's not easy so yeah it's not easy i couldn't tell you i i i've always had sleeping issues um i usually just take uh like over the counter sleep medication or nyquil but it makes you drowsy the next morning so it's like it's a negative effect really yeah the medication <medi> i don't know shit i don't know but i just stopped taking it 'cause i didn't like feeling drowsy not good at all um yeah i mean i recently got released from prison not too long ago uh i'm older now and a lot more responsibilities and i feel like my life is not where it's supposed to be i feel like i could've made a lot more better decisions in my life you know sometimes feeling sorry for myself and just things that i've been through and the whole nine yards so yeah it's all good yeah so true yes <sniffle> about two and a half three years ago <deep breath> <sigh> myself i um i was i was just tired of not i don't know i guess school kind of made me seek help because i started to understand myself how my brain works um you know so i decided to seek help maybe to better my life yeah you could say that yes i am yes yes i do actually i do mm better decision making um better tools to reflect on choices um how to control uh certain situations better yeah um <sniffle> well instead of just always reacting on emotion no matter what kind of emotion it is i step back and and and i assess the situation you know to see what's what's the best way to to react towards the situation and by doing that it has made me more mature emotionally more mature and just has a positive outcome <laughter> um i was lying next to a beautiful woman who who cared about me and the feeling was mutual so that was probably the most happy oh my goodness spontaneous um outgoing sometimes a little crazy um fun that's about it nothing um like i said earlier just you know hurting the the few women that were in my life my past and my friends and family that's about it oh shit uh school is really important um how i carry myself the people who i surround myself with and what i choose to do in my free time those are the few things i would tell myself good music um a good game of basketball um sex um i like going out i like going to parties um social gatherings where everyone's friendly and and there's no drama that's what i like dancing beautiful women a couple drinks that's about it um i guess not not necessarily giving up and and um just just i don't know just keep going just just not giving up really yeah mhm bye bye
365,male,1,12,<synch> sure i'm doing alright new jersey yes three months ago not very often uh it's much different uh i don't know it's just <laughter> it's a lot more crowded here to start a new life for myself it wasn't very easy at all <sigh> uh it was uh it was quite rough at first but you know i'm still trying to get used to life here i've met some good friends here um you know i love the hollywood area um and just you know the mountains are beautiful that's kinda things i love hmm the traffic not really no i don't just haven't had the time or the finances to digital media well i've always loved you know <deep breath> computers and you know designing things and uh i don't know i just kinda fell into it no i dropped out well i i guess my dream job would be working <deep breath> in something that uh i went to school for you know i i never really completed my education um but i guess it'd be great if i went you know back to school and you know finished you know my degree in digital media and uh you know finished and uh started working you know doing something in that field a little bit of both you know i i can be shy at times but i like to push myself to be outgoing you know it's kind of a a struggle for me but i i don't wanna be you know in a shell so i kinda force myself to be outgoing listen to music i uh sometimes just drive and um you know play music in my car and that helps me relax or i smoke a cigarette oh like what ooh um <laughter> just heavy metal that's all i listen to is metal well <sigh> it depends on how high my stress level is and how angry i am but i i do my best to not get so pissed off <laughter> scrubbed_entry and i don't know she um she wanted me to to come and pick her up uh she was a little drunk and uh we just kinda fought over the phone all over some other things and i just ended not picking her up because of her attitude on the phone with me <laughter> yeah it does something i feel guilty about is uh not talking to my kids uh often or as often as i should i've just been so busy with trying to get myself all situated here that i i don't really have time to you know talk to my kids as much as i'd like to you have no idea um it's it comes natural but it's no way easy and uh it's it's the hardest job that i love to do but right now it's extremely difficult for me because they live so far away and i i made this choice to come out here to l_a and i feel bad that i don't see them you know but the reason i came out here was to better myself so i can provide for them fear you know fear <f> just fear will you know you <y> you fear what's gonna happen to your kids you fear that something awful is gonna happen and not seeing them it brings about that fear a lot more you know and i can't i can't always be there with them i can't see them you know it it wasn't as bad when i was living in florida um and i i at least i used to see them it wasn't very often but i used to used to see them now i don't see them at all and that's the that's the hardest thing i've had to do as a parent is to step away from my kids if only temporarily i don't know how long i'm gonna be here for i don't know what my future holds but the hardest thing is being so far away from them just the the joy that they bring to me i mean i could be having a bad day and they just cheer me right up i mean i eh it sucks being away from them for for so long and they're so far away and just not seeing their faces that's it's it's the worst thing ever you know but i i love to just see their faces they they just bring a smile to my face and um i don't know well um i think the fact that i can get down to their level um i'm i'm a bit goofier <laughter> as a father than my dad was with me my dad was you know strict all the time sure he used to you know laugh and play with us but you know he was always very reserved you know and he kinda held back a lot he a lot of his emotions just because you know he was a he was a strong very tough guy um but with me i i i'm very goofy and silly with my kids and i'm strict when i have to be but i always love to you know play around with them as much as possible you know not i don't want them to grow up too fast and that that may have been yeah well <sigh> a situation that i wish i would've handled differently there's so many <laughter> uh i guess when i was still with my ex-wife in florida i wish i wouldn't have gotten so angry or i wish i wouldn't have let her get the best of my emotions she had a tendency to get underneath my skin and uh you know keep picking at me until i exploded and i allowed her to do that you know i i should've just walked away when i could and um you know not let my temper get the best of me no no no uh sometimes it's hard um sometimes i just lay awake in bed <sigh> you know thinking all the things that are going through my head all the you know all the stress that i'm going through with work and you know making sure you know wondering if i'm gonna if i'm gonna be able to make you know rent you know wondering what my kids are going through you know when i'll see them again if they even care about me anymore if they even know they have a father you know those are some of the things that run through my head and and that keeps me up at night sometimes a little <sigh> but <sigh> you know i put myself in this situation so you know i i gotta bear with it you know i gotta you know you reap what you sow so i <sigh> i gotta deal with it in my own way lately um i've been trying to not think so much about you know all that's going into my life uh i try to distract myself and that kind of gets me in a better mood you know if i'm hanging out with friends or just watch a little t_v something to get my mind off you know all the stresses in my life um the last time i felt really happy uh was actually a couple of nights ago i went out drinking with um with a couple of my friends from work and um i don't know we just got pretty drunk and just <laughter> that kinda helped me to forget all the crap that was previously going through my head so if if i can distract myself if i can forget about all that other stuff then i'm happy <sigh> some of my best qualities i guess that i'm convincing <laughter> um uh i'm kind of like a i guess you would say a counselor to some people you know some of my close friends you know i may talk people into doing things that they may regret or i may i mean i'm sorry take talk people out of things that they you know may end up regretting or i may um you know just listen to people so you know eh i could say that you know i definitely you know listen to my friends and help them out in their time of need when they're going through something troubling times like like i'm going through scrubbed_entry uh who lives in florida you know i talk to him every now and then and he's been having troubles with his girlfriend and you know i just kind of talk to him about his problems and listen i mostly <mo> i mainly listen because you know i don't think he has anybody else to listen to you know when i was living in florida i was uh very close with him so you know he he'd always relied on me and now that i'm here in l_a i don't wanna lose that you know connection with him because i mean i've always been there for him so he um he relies on me to listen to his problems and give him some advice you know about what i think you know he should do um so i think <th> i think he appreciates that and i and i'm glad that he you know relies on me for that uh he trusts me enough to tell me all that stuff <laughter> i don't know <sigh> um sometimes i wish i wasn't so kind or generous it seems bad but sometimes i i don't know people may take advantage of me and i may not realize it and um i don't like saying no to people i like to always please people so if i can change that maybe i wish i wasn't such a people pleaser sometimes financially in trouble <laughter> <deep breath> sometimes i you know it you know help others and not you know that may make me broke sometimes yeah i may not have enough to pay bills but i feel better helping people i don't know i regret not breaking up with my ex-wife sooner i regret <re> i regret <re> because she put me through so much crap in my life and um i was always trying to be a people pleaser i was trying to please her you know trying to please my kids as much as i can by not breaking up you know the family but you know there's only so much one person can take and i i think probably if i would've left sooner i may have been happier and things may not have gotten so out of control out of hand like they did you know during all those years with her so maybe if i would've got out sooner i don't know i would've been happier i guess um it's okay to be selfish it's okay to you know think about yourself sometimes you know if you keep putting everyone ahead of you then you're not thinking about yourself you're not thinking about what makes you happy and even though pleasing people may make you happy uh you have to think about yourself sometimes too and about your needs because you know you play an important role in the lives of your close family members and um in order to keep everything afloat you sometimes gotta xxx gotta worry about the one person that's you know juggling everything and holding everything up which is yourself so be a little selfish sometimes it's okay <laughter> i don't even know what a weekend is anymore my ideal weekend would be locked away alone in my room watching movies listening to music just with my cell phone off and not you know being with anybody or it could be out at a bar you know or you know watching a a metal show so i like to be alone but at times i i do wanna be out with uh with others i like you know being around people crazy <laughter> he thinks i'm uh i'm crazy for coming out here but i guess he would say that i'm dedicated and that i'm strong-minded and that you know whatever i set my mind to i can do it you know no matter how hard it is i'm not gonna wimp out so i mean i i really respect him for giving me his insight but uh i guess yeah i guess he would say that i'm crazy but strong-minded <laughter> my kids <sigh> you know that's the one thing that brings joy to me you know like real real joy are my kids and you know just having them in my life is is the proudest thing i can ever accomplish is just you know having them in my life and although i don't get to see them as much even <e> even when i think about them just thinking about you know how far they've gone you know what what they've accomplished in their you know in in their short time i mean eh yeah it makes me happy and i can't wait to see them again one of my most memorable experiences i guess that would be

617,male,1,12,wow  okay  I broke it  not so good  okay  all right questions and then when she's done she should say goodbye and you can press this button  okay  okay  should be how good  yes  I'm doing pretty good  originally I was born in Denver Colorado  I like the beach sunshine  pretty girls  the ocean  other things  smog  excess amount of people in traffic that can be dealt with  I would like to travel more  seeing new things and and learning perhaps if you culture or something  oh okay I when I was younger I went to Europe and just did the backpacking thing  backpack around Europe for a little while and it was it was real fun  I'm probably just being in the military with some friends and stuff like that  why have a degree in film and I'm finishing a degree in or for business as well  now I look for work I'm trying to do some sort of entrepreneurial effort now as I finish my business degree  it'd probably be to own my own company that's kind of why I want some sort of entrepreneurial effort to push push for with some sort of interesting product or service that I'd be working in  I would say middle of the road a little bit shy and at times can be takes a while to warm up  are you cautious to meet someone new and then from there  I kind of see where to go from there I guess  my family they still live in Colorado their interesting people and good as well as I talk to him  pray couple times a week they're good people I have one brother and he has a couple of kids and that he's married as well  that's a good question lately I've been trying to get a daily amount of exercise like jogging or riding a bike and recently got a bike  something like that on a daily  effort  for the most part pretty good I try to if I have an outburst or if I'm being irritable I try to stay away from people who didn't like to go off on people they didn't do anything wrong  Edward change the topic in my mind I guess  what gets me in trouble would be more I avoid things and it kind of builds up and becomes worse  and that kind of gets the trouble and  basically just in a relationship with a girlfriend  to be honest with that it remember exactly what it was about it's just probably in one of us is being irritable and me and  going from there or it's probably a lot to do with the money as well I don't have the best financial security at this point  that's a good question  oh my I guess I I do Harbor a little bit of guilt from the military as far as getting out and people are still in I suppose I know that's it's not for me anymore  only thing well I I used to work at for a friend and I invested into his company  and the economy went down was a construction accessory company basically and kind of movement down and we lost most of our money like most of the folks around America and that pretty much  it was a good and bad thing is you got to look at it from a good good perspective but it definitely put it myself into talespin I financially and couldn't really do anything about it almost was homeless for a little while  but I I wish I wouldn't have invested into the company and just move forward and  perhaps going to school like I'm going anyway  I have  I was 21  I wanted a change in life I wanted some more real-world experiences  answer my country and also the added benefits of going to school or nice I didn't have  much Financial capabilities at that time and I wanted to change to get out of my current situation and that was the best way out I thought  are you happy  yeah yeah I'm very happy I join the military I appreciate it now more that I mount and understanding kind of what I supposed war was about it is definitely changing people and myself as well  yeah I did a tour both in Iraq and Afghanistan as well  see I thought at first it was very easy and then I came to understand he was very difficult  just because I was adjusting from military life and still having that in my head and not until now I realize that I probably just a few months ago  to Reno reintegrate myself a little bit better and choose civilian life which it's it's actually it's actually pretty difficult  no problem  movie think I when I got out of the military  versus I'd I invested like I said into my friend's company and we started that little business we're doing well for the while working and then lost all of our money  and then I traveled for a while at a gender stand now is obviously some other issues but I traveled all over America good working and went to school in New York for a little while  lived in a few different states and came back to California where I'm finishing school finally  living the dream  that's a good question I would say  well it didn't and instills you with with very good I think since of  sense of character and strength and you know I think there's a lot of good qualities that the military are military puts a new people but at the same time it puts a lot of bad qualities  as well because you need some sort of edge or something that you need on on am almost daily basis and if you don't get that then in a lot of guys do you know turn into drinking or drugs just cuz you can't get that same Edge  and that really that can really either hurt or benefit you  I've been feeling okay I've had a bit of a sinus issues lately but I've been feeling okay  actually I have my my thoughts I used to really have scattered thoughts  and  I would say I'm starting to get a little bit better Clarity which is good  taking a lot of different therapy and stuff like that and it it's actually helped  it's it's very as I can't really let the tough part for me is the schedule because that's if I'm not tired you don't sleep you just lay there  it's Hit or Miss really some nights I can sleep pretty well some nights I have to wait till I'm exhausted  and I don't like doing pills  pills are bad I didn't understand that but it's basically just can't sleep because either you're on my mind is always thinking about something or something I feel that I have to do but yet I'm not doing anything that's not true trying to always do something or do you have some some troubling dreams at times but that doesn't really negate me from sleeping and wakes me up is what it does because it can't be that the dream that you remember versus the one that you don't  when I don't sleep well  perhaps your ability and anxiety definitely go up I I definitely get I have a tendency to get a lot of headaches  and not sleeping very well definitely puts that into the mix  I have  not that I know of no  I I don't know I try to feel happiness on a daily basis I guess what you could answer but I'm not certain  I'll say my my dad's been a very positive influence  that's a good question charismatic her funguy pretty tough  a good worker  I'd say I really enjoyed jogging  the other day on the beach  something that I am most proud of I would say I'm actually an online Minister as well and I married my brother and his wife and that was a pretty proud experience  all good  she said goodbye  okay
407,male,0,3,"oh so she's like going to be counselor kind of  and then I just press that  and then we just have that again and they're done cool  haikal  are you okay  yes  I'm actually I feel pretty good cuz I I I slept all day yesterday almost I'm usually doing something if not work it's cool if it's not school it's work and then social life and all that so I actually didn't have work yesterday and I don't have school on have school on the weekdays so I actually slept probably like 85% of the days I actually feel kind of good but I'm actually kind of tired as well I have other stuff going on but other than that I'm good today  okay  I'm originally from Bakersfield California  really  I'm so late when I was an infant and I'm left here when I was around 3 or 4 and I've been moved I moved back here in 07 and I've been living here ever since  well since I've been here since 07 I've only been back maybe  maybe like  couple why were there at 4 like a summer like in 08 I think I was there for like almost all summer but I don't even back up a couple times and since I've been back here  unfortunately  it compared to La doesn't really compare. I grew up in Sacramento actually I didn't get to tell you I was born in Bakersfield and I lived here anyways I don't know if I did I forgot anyways yeah there's like nothing really to do there it's really small as to Valley La has all the stuff to do has oceans and his file kinds of located on by a lot of cool places like Vegas and San Diego and what have you not but yeah other than that I miss my friends and stuff that I don't miss like actual City I just missed some of the people that I grew up with  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I can't see your shoes but I don't travel after I've only been out of California like six time so I would like to travel inside  have enough money to do so  I want to be a filmmaker and which I still want to be a filmmaker and I said I was 10 I took Communications and the general that stuff too and took my video production classes and did a lot of stuff in regards to I'm filmmaking and I have learned a lot of stuff and I still have that knowledge however I haven't really used it since I've been back here in La I did all that stuff in Northern California in Sacramento but and then I transfer switch over to be at the business which I took some classes in that but now I'm actually studying to be an optician and I'm actually almost done with schooling and getting ready to try to get infield and become an optician so  but I do want to be I still want to be a filmmaker and I'm that still one of my plans and I still actually I got into I'm playing poker 2 years ago and I really like the idea of becoming a full-time filmmaker or full-time poker player have it both of those jobs are extremely difficult to make a living out of it have to be like a small percent so we'll see if not then hopefully my optician career could take me somewhere  3 oxygen  I guess I was just trying to find something that it was like it it's like a trade it supposed to private college but it just like specifically trained you into one feel then you just learned that you don't do like your GED and all these other classes like you normally do for like like a major or whatever you're going to do so it just trains you to civically to be auditioning and jump in the field I took it just because I actually want to be a dental assistant sound like something maybe I could do it sounds interesting but then the counselor actually got my attention to be optician so I'm now trying to be an optician and it's interesting so it's fine it's really hard but it's interesting in it and it and it's it's fine  we want to benefit this far as like being able to help people see better and feel comfortable with glasses or contact lenses whatever they feel welcome for what  I'm definitely outgoing however I can be shy sometimes like I'm kind of shy right now because talking to you and your computer and your cartoon or animated or whatever but no usually 98%  I turn on the  hey  but it's the best I've got  I actually was actually kind of funny and I think maybe this might go further some of the poker players to really I've never really talked to any professional poker player to be as far as like I actually playing poker is actually something that helps me forget about anything as far as like  stuff in the past or present or future stuff is coming up as far as like I am really would I really do not think about anything and just think about poker and it actually it's kind of like a therapy thing for me cuz I don't like I guess you could say the kind of drug because I don't think about anything as far as like stressed out or depressed our stuff that's happened in the past I just like focus on poker so it's actually kind of relieved and however playing poker is very stressful on top of that so I guess it's kind of like a catch-22 or whatever but yeah so no poker I put like to play basketball I like to watch movies I can go to the beach actually one of the things I like to do is go to the beach cuz it does it makes me feel good but I usually when you go to the beach when it's hot. During the cold season so it's coming up soon so looking forward to that I'm really busy but I'll try to go to the beach because I can't  I'm really good at controlling my temper actually I've only been in like I'm 30 years old I've been in like six fights maybe and all six of them were started by the other person so I've never started a real fight in my whole life like I started fighting a little kid but talking about like a real stuff like what you get past like 13-14 but yeah I know I'm good like every now and then like there's been in the past were like I wasn't able to control it  but as far as I ever being violent or anyting that's never occurred and never would but for the majority of the time yeah I don't have like people do stupid things all the time and I just like Let It Go expect to like I'm on the freeway and stuff but  oh I mean I get about with my ex girlfriend a lot but it was just about really Petty things I guess that maybe we just I think we were good for each other but maybe some other lifetime because we just bumped head too much so obviously she's my ex-girlfriend probably for a reason so  we just argued about girlfriend boyfriend thing  I guess my film  there's a lot of stuff I got to handle differently about  maybe like when I was doing really good when I was younger and I was working for  production assistant for a filmmaker's around where I live in Sacramento so I was doing everything that I want to do as far as my dreams are concerned and had a lot on my stuff together I have my own car mode apartment and then I got involved with like the wrong group of people I guess and kind of tumble down hill from there in like lost everything like our apartment so I just wish that maybe I never got involved with those kind of people that kind of girl ever  because I would probably a pirate my life probably a lot different now however I believe that everything happens for a reason and obviously I think you should also like stuff that happens good or bad  learn from your mistakes so that when it happens again you could not make that mistake our try not to make it as bad yes so you know  I guess  hardest decision  the hardest decision I have ever had the maid would be  I guess you could say I don't really know  can I say that I  maybe like my ex-girlfriend like I couldn't like  stayed with her and I really like it still am in love with her and would like to be with her and miss her but I guess the biggest decision that I had to make was like I know that wasn't like a healthy relationship and I know if we like stay together if we got married or have kids that I don't think would end up working out anyways so I guess the decision the hardest decision would be till like actually stay away from her and not get back with her and not with her so I guess that was a hard really hard decision because I could easily have done it and I guess maybe I would have been happier that way but stressed out and irritable or whatever and other way of having to deal with her iguess deal with each other our relationship so it's really hard still is so I guess that's not choosing to be with someone that I loved and loved me  or whatever so  what was that  I beg your pardon  navad  I understand the first part of that question  oh an event own event okay that can erase  event that I can erase for my memory  IMAX girlfriend I wish I never met her  my first girlfriend in my last girlfriend I wish I never met them cuz we were we were together and love for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard so I guess both of them  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep extremely I could fall asleep anywhere I actually the other day I broke a record I almost fell asleep standing up which would have been weird because I guess I would have fallen down or something I don't know I just caught myself I guess I was I mean I was really tired but I do a lot of stuff so it's hard for I don't really get that much sleep  as much as I would like but I can sleep when I'm dead or whatever  have they said  I know  no  lately I'm just tired but I'm all right I guess I'm dealing with this breakup still it's only been like a month and a week but it's actually is not I mean I've had worse things happen I mean worst things happening had worse things happen to us  well-known religious person that I'm Catholic I believe in God I know there's a God so obviously even though all of it even devoted people to God regardless of what they are they sometimes stay so I do stay sometimes but definitely last for that long and I know that there is a God and I know that I'll be okay and everything will be okay but you know it's hard to deal with them like I don't really I just keep going and I go to school and work and I just have to keep going I can't give up so I just try to stay busy and staying busy helps kind of been like sleeping a lot house but I don't go to sleep a lot so I don't know playing poker  playing basketball helps me deal with him hanging out with my friend sometime  I felt really happy on Friday because I went to San Diego for the first time and I didn't it wasn't as cool as I thought it would be but we're like under circumstances as far as like my friend had business to take care of and it took a long time so I would much rather been free during that time but I wasn't but we had fun it was cool I enjoyed it so yeah I really like that I was at fun and I was happy about going to San Diego for the first time and I am had a good time  a lot of things but I guess I would say like be nicer to like family members know a couple family members that I wish I would have been different to  at the different to not that I was like a horrible but I could have been nicer in some instances that if I didn't know the situation at hand and I would have never like really went out and partied all the time like I did like Highschool different part times of a type I would have just really focused on schooling and stuff them in to the party later would have gotten relationships that I'm sorry I just told myself more basely to be more have more Direction be more focused I guess I stay away from people and unhealthy relationships and healthy people I guess not that I'm the healthiest but yeah I just want it done a lot of stuff different but I don't know if she said earlier but I believe everything happens for a reason  so I guess everything is happening now for reason something to keep going  I guess there's a few that I do have a few that I used to have cuz I have best friends now couple I guess one new one and I've lost a few best friends as far as like just not we like 100 ways but I guess they're all probably describe me more as like energetic funny crazy loud silly  smart and I just I guess in general just like entertaining to be around I have  I haven't always been the best bestest best friend but I tried you know my hardest  so that's cool  change myself  I wish I was  I wish I was like 15 pounds lighter  I wish I didn't need  how do I set potatoes I feel like  I feel like I'm I feel like I need to be like in a relationship with a girl but I feel like I wish I didn't have to be like feel like that I needed to have a girl all the time and so I get that, like focus more and I wish that like I didn't need sexual I wasn't always think about sexual stuff towards girls all the time as far as like me having to be in a sexual thing with them like as far as like wanting sex as much as I do cuz I feel like if I didn't concentrate our have to like be with girls are in a relationship to like well I don't know how to say it but I was saying like there's a guy friends that I know that don't need sex as much as I do and I feel like I need it more than I feel like sometimes that I wish I didn't need as much so maybe I guess I'm addicted to it a little bit more like I can focus on more things other than just I mean I don't just focus on sex but I just feel like if I focused on it if I didn't want it need it or think I need it as much that I could get  step dad in my life  but that sometimes I'm working on that  what am I most proud of  I'm most proud of  almost I guess I guess I'm most proud of working for television station back in Sacramento and working on a lot of them film sets cuz like I I was 16 and I decided I want to be a filmmaker and then two years later or year-and-a-half later you basically I got I started making steps to become a filmmaker and then I ended up working in the business and working as a filmmaker for a really really really good I'm cinematographer I really good I'm freelancing to Target for those that lives in Sacramento that deal I think so I'm proud that I had a dream and I went for it and I actually ended up doing stuff to go toward my dream that were in my dream so I guess that's one of my biggest accomplishment which was like over 10 years ago but I know hopefully something like that could happen again soon or no  perfect  goodbye  cool"
461,male,1,17,hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today yes  okay  Los Angeles  I like the Arts I like the weather  I like the people  it's expensive smoggy a lot of traffic  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer  no I don't  well I like I like where I live I don't like to leave my familiar surroundings  I didn't I didn't study anytime  enough to make enough money to survive  that would be a dream job  somewhere in the middle  maybe shy  I just try and just meditate  it's not easy  not not real good at it but I don't get angry too often  actually I think it has yes  can you tell me about  I work situations where you get angry with another employee and  you should be more cool and calm  oh  summer day a few days ago it was about  somebody's excessive drinking  hand and money  not my drink soda  frustrated  person wasn't able to listen very easily  okay  well stuff that were dating back 20 years ago things in my marriage  maybe arguing or  being difficult  sure I could have  I could have been more mindful in certain situations  one of them was whether or not I was should  get married when I was much younger  I didn't want to disappoint my my girlfriend she wanted to get married so I didn't want to hurt her feelings  are you happy  yes  I think I did that didn't I  instances where I wasn't an attentive father  you always want to be the best you can I'm very hard on myself.

381,male,1,16,okay thanks  hi I'm Ali thanks for coming in today  I was created to talk to people and it's safe  are you okay  yes  okay  from Santa Monica  other people mostly  all the people all suck  I know not a lot  I can't afford to travel as much as I'd like to  I was an English major  I just like reading a lot at the time so it sounded like the best thing well the most fun thing to study  no not anymore  I love my job you could only say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job  it's my dream job would be to manage a soccer club  always be pretty much impossible for me  I don't have any experience in that field  very shy  sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got  I play music  what I do when I'm annoyed I don't know  I do what I'm annoyed  I can't think of anything I don't know  I don't think I don't do anything specifically  I pretty good I would say very good I don't lose my temper very often  I was the last time I argued with someone  I can't remember  I don't have a lot of conflicts with people I can't remember the last time I argued with someone  well it see when I was  a little kid  I was outside my grandparents restaurant and there was a robbery and I saw it I what I saw it when when the robbers were leaving  that maybe I would want to erase it from my memory if I could  well I didn't know what was happening in that moment so I didn't feel so bad at the time but I felt bad afterward because then  you're my mother was upset by my mother was there and she had to call the police and it was it was disturbing to see her you know really disturb that way but at the time it actually happened I wasn't really upset was more the aftermath of it  consideration that  I don't know  all I can think about this probably a million situations that I would have I would say I would have handled differently I can't think of one in particular  Maybe  I think that when I was a kid  well I think that when I was at sea  well I have okay have a good one  I didn't marry the girl that I think that I should have married so that's a big one for me  yeah well we were together for about 4 years  and I think I just took her for granted when I just didn't commit  and them  that was a long time ago and now that it's been so many years I realized well I don't know they fight the realization but I think now that  that yes she should have been my wife that we were meant for each other are made for each other  but because my selfishness and because I just  I have this fear of commitment at the time I just felt like I didn't  they didn't do what I should have done with with a smart thing would have been  what's something you feel guilty about  well the last thing I can think of that I would say I feel guilty about was  now I feel a lot of guilt about my my friendships I'm not I don't feel like I'm as good of a friend as I could be but then at the same time I don't really know exactly what the  how I could be a better friend I just feel a little guilty that I'm not that I can't help people anyone who has a problem I can't I never feel like I can help anyone  who I know who has a problem so  how that happens every day I guess if that happens with everyone who I know and everyone  all of my relatives and all of my friends I don't feel like I can really give them anything or help them in their lives  tell me about your relationship with your  well there  it's very distant it's it's just it's very cordial and it's very  I don't know what the word is it's hot it's kept it a very surface-level I don't think that they know I don't think that my family really knows me very well at all  and I don't know them very well either not nothing to hide in a true sense  so  yeah it's  I think a lot of families are that way but it is it does bother me that mine is that way  how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep so it's very easy I sleep a lot and I  yeah I have no problem sleeping at all  no not really I would say  the way I'm now it's the way I think I've been my whole life so  you didn't when I was a little kid I slept a lot also and no I don't think I've changed much  I'm pretty down but like I said  in a way I could tell you how I'm feeling really down but then again I've always been this way so it's hard to say that it's down when it's consistently that way  yes  I would long time ago I was about 10 years old  around there about  I was just missing a lot of school I didn't want to go to school so we eventually they sent me to  to a therapist and then to a psychologist and then to a psychiatrist and  I want from there  you still go to therapy now no I haven't gone to therapy since I was a teenager  why did you stop  well I didn't feel it was helping me at all so one day I just  decided I didn't want to go anymore  affected you  well like I said it I didn't feel that it helped me  so I guess it's not enough that it affected me much  no I wouldn't say disturbing no  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  well I feel pretty happy whenever I see my nephew  and I have a  my best friend's children are I feel like their mind my nephew and my niece and I'm pretty happy when I'm around them  that's great  tell me how you spend your ideal weekend  my ideal weekend would be  I would probably be traveling I would  really enjoyed getting out of the city every weekend  it going anywhere really just anywhere out of the city  I just seen the way different people live and how people are different wherever you go I really do think people are different when you go to different places and  how they interact with you and how they see the world different food  and I also like historical places I mean to history and I and I enjoy this visiting anywhere that has some sort of  historical significance  awesome  I haven't taken a trip in a long time  the last trip I really took was I went to France a few years ago for a wedding  and I had a really good time there I had always wanted to go to Paris and so I got to go to Paris and then I went to a little town  what's a few hours away from Paris where the actual wedding was  I knew it was really fun I think that the church where the wedding was was like a thousand years old so  that was a really cool trip  I got to know I don't have it I don't know what's what would would be considered memorable  a memorable experience  probably the most memorable experience I guess which is be  nothing in particular but but living with the girl who I just who I told you earlier that I think now that we should have gotten married  that's something that stays in my memory that's why I'm saying it's memorable because  it's it's still with me in the  it's something that I don't think you know what I know I'll never forget but it's not any particular day or any particular moment  a lot  check it be healthier  for one thing and more energetic  and the more friendly I think I am pretty friendly  but more more outgoing more more more social  those two things mainly I guess that I would like to be more and more social more enthusiastic and more and healthier  that's a good question my best friend how would my best friend describe me I think  I think he would say that I am  a very cheesy but probably say that I'm a very spiritual person  and that I'm very giving I think I'm a lot more selfish than people think I am but people think that I'm not selfish  and probably he would say there in Creative also  put my advice to to myself I don't understand the question  is there anything you regret  yeah but we already talked about it  no I can't. I don't think I really believed in and being proud or in the end Pride  I don't think that it accomplishments are really something to be proud of but I can't really think of  any accomplishments  anyway even if I did have something to be proud of. I can't think of any any sort of accomplishment I've had  something I did recently that I really enjoyed  well I signed karaoke with a couple of friends of mine  I don't usually do that but  yeah that was a lot of fun a few days ago  thank you  I was more difficult than I thought it was going to be just kind of had me stumped a lot and a lot of the time and I was  I think I got better after a little while and I was  at first I thought I was going to get mad because I'm not saying anything and I don't know how to answer and
423,female,0,0,<sync> yes i'm doing well los angeles the greater los angeles area people diversity and various entertainment and activities um fickle weather traffic and litter i have traveled domestically not internationally seeing other places and how people live and the culture the last trip that i went to was san diego but uh from childhood or as an adult um family vacations to um baja and rosarito beach yeah the reason why that memory comes to mind because um this weekend is easter and we usually will go down to easter <east> easter spring break to rosarito baja um i have a bachelor's <b> bachelor's in communication studies because it's a open field just doesn't deal with um communication interactively but performing arts telecommunications business entrepreneurship so no i'm not i'm actually unemployed um i think to own my business that's my dream my dream job to have my own company um i would like to open something in like the telecommunications area as a business something do online online services um i like to make things with my hands so my next venture would would be to create all natural soy candles something in that area um a mixture a mixture of shy and outgoing because i have to observe people and crowds and that's how i usually make a determination if i remain reserved or remain open i listen to like a meditation tape or i take a walk or go get a massage fair oh man <laughter> uh probably yesterday or this morning um usually the argument is about me making myself clear or me repeating myself twice no it usually gets the other person in trouble mm i redeemed a service from a mechanic who fixed my transmission and i had a warranty and i wrote to the department of consumer affairs and the guy offered me a portion of the settlement agreement and i decided to take him to small claims court to get a bigger amount and i wish i would've have taken the offer that he gave me at the midst of dealing with the third party which was the department of consumer affairs and because of that i took him to small claims court and i end up losing the whole settlement and only been offered a very small portion so i wish i would've taken the higher road than taken the lower road i don't tend to feel guilty about too many things hardest decision uh i don't know financially emotionally mm emotionally letting go a past relationship it's the hardest thing that i i won't say the hardest thing but it was a difficult thing yes it was a relationship of seven years but um that person has already moved on so uh they want me to be in their life in hopes that if something goes wrong with my current relationship we'll always have something to fall back on uh yeah it is hard um an event something i could erase from my memory um i don't know <laughter> there's a lot of events that i just automatically erase from my memory but whatever comes to mind right um probably the death of a relative um alone and misinformed because i didn't know that they were that sick and i didn't know that they were um their days were numbered and i could've had more opportunity to spend time with them and make better a better connection in the last days um it's fair to midland mm my immediate i'm very close but distant not very close my mother um yes uh she's encouraged me to continue my education to always fall back on my hobbies hopes goals and dreams she always encourages me to always stay aloof and out there looking for a better opportunity and she encourages me to not be afraid to explore other ventures easy <laughter> easy <laughter> i've been feeling well um yes a little stressed but i'm trying to manage that i leave the stressful environment um in the past about three years ago um because i was having issues in my learning environment and um i feeling <f> i was feeling emotionally attacked yeah i was having uh a issue with a professor who was just very i don't know a a very different personality and he almost ran me down the crosswalk at school i felt i felt um like i was in a a dishonest environment i felt like i wanted to get you know switch his class and get into another class but i had no choice but to stay in there and deal with his meanness for the whole semester um i think through finding p_t_s_d they were trying to link depression no financially i'm not capable and i haven't found a counselor who is willing and committed to working with me and helping me with my issues i find that a lot of counselors they listen to me and then they laugh at me and then they tell me the opposite of what's what i'm telling them mhm mm last time i felt really happy i really don't know that's a good question um just just did what i want i just relaxed i just relaxed and i you know i don't know <laughter> i don't have any best friends my best qualities that i'm uh hard working i'm reliable i'm a excellent friend um i'm energetic and i'm a go getter things that i wish i could change about myself probably be less sensitive don't take things so personally and um learn how to help myself before helping others no i don't have any regrets in my life um if i could've do things differently ten years ago i probably would've focused and studied more and less being out of the house and hanging with friends mm that i got have a a college education and i'm self sufficient and i can pay my bills by myself <laughter> and i'm alive goodbye

367,male,1,19,are there any parameters aren't I mean is should I just talk naturally or just went wherever I'm comfortable okay I get there  one last thing  let you know when she's done I'm going to hand you the  okay  and please  are you okay with this  yes  how are you doing  I'm okay I'm a little  pensive I guess a little down but more or less okay  I was born in Annapolis Maryland on the East Coast  originally I moved because I went to film school and but then I decided to come move back to Washington DC to do some work and now I'm back here again  it's very different being from the East Coast it just has a different feel to it but living  La is very as a very different kind of attitude I guess and so it's a little difficult but I but I've gotten more used to it since I've been here  not at all when I left things got things are sort of I lost my job out there and so I had to move out here kind of quick to to be with  some people who are going to help me out and I'm just I don't know if it's strange just the right word but I'm kind of not really speaking to my family are old friends that off  it's not easy it's  it's kind of  I miss I miss a lot of people I miss my old life before I lost my job I miss some friends I miss a lot of the relationships that I had out there so it's difficult I mean it weighs on my mind a lot I feel like I failed and now I'm here and I can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard  you consider yourself more shy or outgoing  depends on the situation I think I'm out going when I'm comfortable and then I'm extremely outgoing but when I'm in a situation I'm not comfortable with this I tend to be a lot more shy so that doesn't really answer your question but  I have certain  I do I do a lot of writing I have certain music that I listen to as I'm writing and when I can when I can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world the music and the the thoughts just kind of happening really it can it soothed me it's like it's when I feel most relaxed I guess  when is the last time that happened  a few weeks ago I guess I was I've been working on a on a on a book on a novel and when I was really what I was really getting into writing it and  it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good I felt like I was accomplishing something and I was felt really relaxed  what was it about  it was about  guy who's searching for something it's  it's it's his last day on Earth and so he's going to find a person that he that he met and just  I was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes he has on Earth with her just because  certified it's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing  what made you decide to do that  well I've always I've always been a writer part of the reason I came to La was because of screenwriting so I wrote some screenplays and you know had a little bit of success with that out here and but since since that I kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and I've started to write more short stories and and longer just creative writing so I've been meaning to write a novel by just waiting for the idea that to really hit me  how hard is that  it's not easy the the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle I find it difficult I have a real love hate relationship with writing when I when I love it I just absolutely love it but sometimes I hate it because it's so difficult but it's worth it for the times when it when it's good  how are you at controlling your temper  good I don't I don't really have a temper it's not I mean most of my anger that I have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people if something is really really stressful if I'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation I can lose it but I've put probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life I mean generally I pretty much try to it when I'm upset I get upset with myself not with other people  when was the last time you argue with someone  last night I guess I got in an argument about whether or not  cleaning vegetables was necessary because of I forget but it well know it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because I'd already started cutting the vegetables and I thought that would be okay so it turned into this big argument and we did Google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and I I ended up being wrong on that one but it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow-up argument but it was a definite argument  okay  what's something you feel guilty about  lot so much  I was in a relationship that I really really better really wanted to work and  I ended up and it was partly due to I hadn't I was on that I wasn't on the right medication and so I was going like everything that sort of spiraled out of control and I feel really guilty about the way that that ended I mean I wasn't I wasn't mean but I was but I was getting more and more messed up and I couldn't stop it and it ended and so I feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not  and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again so  that was pretty that was pretty tough  you've done anything to avoid it  what some of it was was that  I wasn't medicated properly I mean now I've been to a doctor and I'm on medication that's  completely kind of I mean I still get I still get upset and I still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not I don't completely lose it for days at a time so I mean I know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if I had if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then I would have then it would have probably been different if I was who I am now then I would have I would I would be  I would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but I mean I could have  I don't know I don't know if I could have done anything different  things being how they were  I mean it's  it's possible I mean obviously  yeah because I mean that's what I do I I  take little I mean I take little things and I just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy I dwell on stuff and it's like any little detail that comes up I suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day I mean I still I still get I still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed and I feel ashamed about stuff that I did in high school which was years and years ago I which I shouldn't even be thinking about anymore cuz it's so in the past but I still get that feeling like I'm right back there  that sounds really hard  well it's not easy I've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it I mean I dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to slow my mind down that way but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better  well like I said I do a lot of you know if I'm if I'm writing or if I'm doing anything like I kind of have to almost  you doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely if I'm watching TV I have to be playing a game on my phone if I'm using the computer I have to be you know watching a TV show or a movie on you know on it in another window so that I can just keep my mind occupied during all that  I just need I mean I I wish that I could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but I just I can't yet  I need triggered by something  they're triggered by everything pretty much anything that I said I see if I if I if I hear somebody with a Dutch last name if I if I hear somebody talk about Wisconsin if I hear you know she will talk about  anyting you know I can reach back and connect to  to this it's really it's really  I don't know that's the thing I mean I don't ever get a break  from it  now  how easy is it for  I'm a very light sleeper so I'm awake and asleep and awake and is I have no problem going back to sleep but I generally you know don't  I don't know I'd never really needed much sleep so it's just only recently that I've really started to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep like I would I would usually stay up until 2 or 3 in the morning so that I could just be so exhausted that I would just calling out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work but now it's it's it's like if I do that I can't I still don't get enough sleep I don't clock out I still just sleep very lightly you know I get up I toss and turn all night you know and now  it's just it's  yeah I don't sleep too great right now  pretty I mean I don't know it's hard to it's hard to know I usually just kind of power through it and just I'm at I'm like how I am now I just I just feel bad  okay  how long ago were you diagnosed  I think  334 years ago  it was when I  I had been given taking stuff for anxiety for 4  years before that but then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you actually got this situation and we need to get you the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so  so yeah that was that was kind of a turning point but unfortunately it happened after everything went bad so  at the moment I don't know I don't really think I thought about it too much then but looking back on it I feel  it really makes me angry it really makes me you know given where I am right now it makes me really angry that I'm  that I had that I I lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain because of things that I couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me I mean I was paying I was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing it you know it wasn't  it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know I managed to find somebody who did work and I just yeah so I'm I'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now  there really wasn't any choice I had to I was I was a mess I was it was either  I was I was self-medicating it was affecting my work I mean it was everything was just there was a point where I really realized that I mean I just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and and all this stuff you know they just decided that I was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off  but it was at least that and not  firing me but but but yeah but so I got help but it was  but it wasn't soon enough  not not as much as I should  I go to a couple of meetings I go to I go to AA so that I can you know keep control of that aspect to 2 and there's a there's a therapy aspect that unfortunately you know being unemployed my unemployment ran out you know I'm time you know what I'm getting my medication from the city of La so you know I'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody so I have a psychiatrist that I go see but it's really  very I've only seen her three times in the past year so basically to keep my medication coming  then there's you  right  changes have you noticed  well like I said I mean  this the top I mean let's just take the AAA for example because that's probably the close closest for that I'm seeing with therapy right now just saying stuff out loud is just like getting getting the stuff out trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense  that you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a a therapist or just a room full of of drugs you know I mean you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something that you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing  you know better than I that I have been I mean  it is sort of a good it has its ups and downs you know I'm applying for jobs 5-6 jobs or more a day you know I never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to 2 to being self-sufficient again it's hard but that's like real world problems I feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control so now it's just I have to deal with real life witches  Jazz at the juices don't own challenge  it was probably you know a couple of years ago  I was I mean the thing that immediately comes to mind is everything was going well at my job I was making these great videos with this person that I ate that I was having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a Christmas tree  and we spent it all this time picking out the perfect Christmas tree and it was just  feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger  the bigger life  that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel  you know for that instant I felt like  a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and  I mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant I felt like a normal person a normal happy person and  part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that  I don't know if I'll ever feel that again  so  what are you most proud of in your life  probably the  probably this educate educational series I did educational video series I did for the National Science Foundation  it was it was really hard and it would but in the end it turned out really good and you know I'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about  in about the world around them so that I feel like that was a real contribution that I made to the world  I was part of you know it's part of my my job it was it was a we were trying to come up with with new ideas for because we were put together videos and stuff to give you know to two schools and everything and they had done this before but we decided to do something really big you know when there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of  and there was a lot to it and so it was probably the biggest  project that the NSF has decided to do and so we just kind of produced it  I guess  I don't know I don't know it's been awhile it's been awhile since I've since I've really thought about that I don't know what I'd go somewhere would I  I don't know  thank you  Audi
482,male,0,1,<synch> yes i'm doing fine i was born in texas and i moved to california when i was three and grew up here in california yeah i was yes uh i've never been back there um don't have any relatives there don't have a reason to go back there um <makes sound with mouth> <laughter> well my my family's here that's one uh the weather's great uh the beaches and mountains are here all those things are very good uh the traffic which is probably <probab> probably most people say um it's expensive to live here those are probably the top two uh recently i've traveled um well you get to see new places and and new people you get to learn more about other cultures and uh different ways people think oh uh at the end of march i went to ecuador for a week uh um i spent most of most of one day with with an ecuadorian who only speaks spanish and i speak very little spanish so we got um it was it was challenging for me trying to communicate with him i felt like a a little kid trying to you know say you know what's this what's this uh it was very humbling um you know just just seeing that you know when you don't when you're not able to communicate then that that can be very difficult i'm probably more of a shy person genetics i don't know why um i'm an electrician so i studied electrical construction i've also studied uh computer networking um it was i guess just uh kinda circumstances i needed the the the work i was doing wasn't providing for the family and i knew someone who could get me a job doing electrical work and so so i pursued that because of the the financial gain mm uh it's given me a lot of opportunity but uh i don't think it's what i what i wanna do for the rest of my life well i'm actually uh pursuing becoming a missionary uh my wife and i are looking at moving down to ecuador in the fall uh for four years and last year we we trained in north carolina for one year um and that was like theology and bible training um basically god put a um a desire in my heart to get beyond get beyond myself and and do something for other people to to go and and learn about another people their culture and to share the gospel with them well in my immediate family um i'm i'm married i've been married for ten years this june and we have four daughters and then um but i i have one older brother uh no sisters um so what what do you wanna know about my family um i'm really close with my wife and my daughters uh with my brother i'm not not real close partly because he's uh he's mentally handicapped um he has the mental capacity of a seven year old even though he's he's five years older than me so just kinda because of that dynamic it it's hard to have a a close relationship with him but i am pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents um i'd say my my youth pastor in high school he was a real real positive influence in me um just he has a he has a drive and a zeal for for pursuing the truth um and just uh studying the bible and and because of his influence that kinda put me on a path to wanting to study the bible um i think i've gotten better at it there have been times when you know i'll i'll get angry and uh you know it can just kinda really rule over me just the frustration and i'm the type of person that it takes me um usually it it takes some time for me to get angry and and some time to to calm down again but i've i've learned um over time that really getting angry um and keeping that anger in doesn't it doesn't attack the other person or the thing that i'm angry at it just kinda attacks me and so really it it's not a it's not a good behavior to to keep so when <whe> when things anger me i try to uh like talk to the other person say you know this <th> this situation is making me upset i try to kinda talk through it and and resolve it and come to a resolution um even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root the problem um <sigh> well a a couple weeks ago or maybe it was maybe even a month ago um my wife and i were going on a trip with with her parents and her parents had already left um eh we were just driving down to orange country area for this trip and my wife wanted um wanted she had she had expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things be packed and but hadn't really in <i> in my eyes hadn't expressed that clearly but in her eyes she had and so when i was trying to meet those expectations she um you know i i didn't meet 'em according to to what she wanted and and and she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted um and kinda getting attacked for it so so then i i i started yelling at her and and we you know we had that conflict but then you know with <wi> within an hour or so we had kinda talked through and we we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was um are you asking the moment of during the conflict uh very you know just mm very angry you know you can feel it in your body um part partly i the i guess the anger was probably the secondary response but my initial response was that um i felt <f> was feeling attacked and that came out as anger so i would think um yeah so initially i felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger mm hmm hmm hmm i guess it was um deciding to go um to go to our training last year um i i felt that god had put on my heart that that this was something i was supposed to pursue um my wife didn't feel that way and i i i just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue and but at the same time i knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it it would it would kinda fall apart so i kinda relinquished <r> relinquished it um and i and i said to her you know i'm not gonna make you go um you know if if you wanna go then <th> then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll we'll look at at doing something else and not going uh and so that that was difficult for me 'cause uh you know again that that that kinda felt like a loss 'cause i felt deeply that that's what i was supposed to do um but then after i kinda gave that up then um then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about about doing this and then we went ahead and pursued it so um so just kinda giving it up was <wa> was <wa> was difficult for me tell you about something bad or something that i can erase from my memory um oh let me see i'm not sure um i don't know i i can't really think of anything very traumatic um that i would wanna erase but i i think you know good things and positive <posi> eh good things and bad things they all kinda shape who we are and so i i i can't think of anything that i would want to erase um usually usually it's not too bad um are are you referring to on the the questionnaire where i said that i had trouble <trou> some trouble sleeping um the the job i work the the um kinda the the scheduling has shifted so i so lately i've been working some nighttime shifts or graveyard shifts so um coming home in the morning you know when it's light then it's been hard for me to sleep but it was it was mostly 'cause i was staying up so late because of work uh it pretty easy um when i when i don't sleep then i do get cranky uh i i've been feeling good lately no not really no no um hmm i don't know um can't think of anything that was kinda out of the ordinary but um yesterday we my wife and i took took our three <th> our our three younger girls we took them to the park the oldest one um stayed with her grandma but we uh we took 'em to the park and they played and yeah so those <th> those are always happy times when we take the kids to the park um i i think he'd say i'm a a family man that um i'm uh dependable that he can he can count on me um usually my my friend i end up doing um different work around the house for him 'cause i'm kind of a handyman so so in that way i i i think he'd say i'm kinda dependable or someone he could go to for advice um i guess i would um i guess i would like to be able to um start conversations with people easier uh sometimes i have i have trouble just talking to people especially if they're in a group if <i> if people are one on one then it's it's usually easier for me to talk to them but kinda talking to people in a group uh i wish i was a little better at that now if it's okay what what i was gonna say right before that was that um uh if if i'm giving a speech or something to a large group i don't really have a problem with that but if it's more interaction type thing then that's kinda difficult uh advice i would've given to myself ten or twenty years ago um probably would've been to to go to college right away instead of going to school later in life um that's about it think that would made that would've made the biggest difference in my life i think um well i have i have four kids and i hope i'm raising 'em right i hope that that um you know the mistakes that i've made i can kinda guide them through their their journey in life and i hope that they end up a little better for it than than me um yeah i just hope hope kinda through them that i can you know leave <lea> leave something worthwhile you're welcome goodbye
351,female,1,14,yes <clears throat> okay um new york um to pursue um music industry a job in the music industry  uh yes i'm self-employed um to become a music producer um it's pretty hard there's a lot of competition <laughter> um to pursue a job uh when um about a year ago last february it was pretty difficult east coast is a lot different than the west coast um i think i've been there twice in the past year no i'm more of a creature of habit um yes uh sometimes i feel like i don't fit into the crowd so um it's better just sometimes to be more quiet and view everything instead of uh you know going in and actively pursue things um <laughter> probably uh listen to music um and spend time with my dogs um <clears throat> probably um people being insensitive <insen> um not very um very nice to me or um seeing injustices or um i think that's about it <laughter> um pretty good you know sometimes <so> um probably couple of days ago um one of my friends was saying that um mm uh they were making a comment about how i am and i got kind of upset about that yeah it does <laughter> pretty close um my best friend so i um oh just one of my friends um i kind of am quiet about it and when a person pushes me to a certain point that's when i overreact usually um it's pretty hard um i rather the person notice that i'm kinda getting withdrawn and actively engage in me instead of getting it to the point where it's like um it it comes to a point where it blows out of proportion  um um probably spending time with my family in new york very close um my sister and my brother um i don't know they're just great people and i love them a lot and they're a lot like me so i feel like i have people that understand me um probably um i guess loyal um sensitive um <laughter>  i don't know it's kind of hard <laughter> it's a hard question <laughter> no no <clears throat>  yes gosh um i think probably nineteen ninety seven so a long time ago um i'm just uh during that time i was just going through a lot of issues and i was feeling unsafe to myself so i ended up going um to the doctor to kinda get meds and have therapy and stuff um not currently i i did about like six months ago um i just felt the therapist wasn't really helping me um i felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over and xxx she wasn't really challenging me and i've been in therapy for a really long time so i just knew it was a change it's okay <laughter> um yes i do actually um  when i feel connected to a therapist um and when i feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what i'm going through um so yes i do um i'm better at describing my emotions and feelings i think the biggest thing is um when i'm in situations eh i can see myself reacting one way and i take a step back and see how i can react normally almost in a way um    also i tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel like really bad about myself so it's nice to talk to someone that's not judging that doesn't really tell me like you know um they tell me it's o okay basically <clears throat> um feeling hopeless all the time not having you know enough energy to do things i used to like i had a little bit of concentration issues  um having weird disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind and just overall just feeling kinda crummy about life  um sometimes they are at  like random moments that if there's like a problem with like my interpersonal life or something like that or if i sometimes even seeing something on television um like sometimes that affects me  um listening to music or trying to distract myself um trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal to record things <clears throat>  um it's been a tough transition to come here so uh well being <be> being here um so um kinda half and half okay and not okay <laguhter>  um i feel like i've been a little bit with more withdrawn lately um but that's about it um <clears throat> some days it's great some days it's not um more recently it's been a little bit more difficult um i don't know why i have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night <clears throat> so i tend not to sleep very well and i wake up quite frequently during the night <clears throat> um <clears throat> very groggy in the morning and um that's about it like during the day i tend to yawn a lot and my friends always are like oh why are you yawning so much are you disinterested <disisinterested> in what we're doing and then trying to tell them it's not that at all <laughter> um probably christmas time when i was with my family  um just really happy and um feeling like everything was alright in my life  having a good sense of like where i was at that moment being present with myself um probably you know um let's see that's a hard question i think probably i can tend to read people kinda well sometimes and um  uh i like to say uh i'm good at like being a good friend to people being a good family member um i'm a hard worker when i do have a job so <laughter>  um um sure i mean it's life so of course there's regrets um one that comes to mind is um the wish that i don't eat as much so i can be a lot more healthy <laughter>  um don't take things so seriously <laughter> um enjoy being youthful and um i think that's it <laughter> um i don't know that's a good question probably um my previous job and my employment i worked really well with kids um  so i did a great job at that i was um a researcher um at a hospital and i helped a lot of kids out for about six years so seven years  yeah it was awesome um i was really kind of like um  reading people and so i decided to major in psychology <clears throat> so uh and then i went a worked in a um mental health facility and did research um with them with um with drugs and depression and things like that so it found like a good niche for me <laughter> okay no problem <laughter> goodbye <laughter>
453,male,1,17,hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today yes  Los Angeles  convenience convenience  people the crowd  traffic  people that lack of respect  locally originally  meeting old people I love talking old people  I work a lot with my elders in my reservation and other reservations here in California and I spend a lot of time with her with the elders I talked with them and they helped me out of  Target are good stories  going in the mountains and seeing waterfalls then no one else is saying except for my people and I was the most beautiful thing I think I found  it depends on the situation if I'm if somebody comes to me looking for me to help them I take control it if I need help with its I work at asking for help so it depends on the situation  I Garden  and I think  very good.  3 days ago it was about communication and the lack of communication on the other person's part and I needed them to communicate better so that way I could understand and they didn't communicate so we had an argument and I got to settle  I felt I'm caught off guard because this is an individual that I spend pretty much almost every minute of my day with and to not be told what was going on in this person's head and then to have a situation arise and I was kept out I didn't like that  I got a pass  probably lack of time spent with my grandparents  just wanted on you regret that you didn't miss time with spend time with me  I want thing I truly wish I could remember I was I was a professional athlete and what time I have party till like 4 in the morning and then I had did my event at like 10 in the morning and I was my captain and I'm very smile team  that's one thing I truly believe that  are the professional fighter soon  yeah I'm not party. About other people besides myself  I studied massage therapy and Nursing degree  a lot of it's just been on job education  I'm very  I'll get to my own injuries I just going through the therapy process and believing in people and seeing how it worked and I decided to do that I wanted to help people too  are you happy  oh yeah  yes  I want to paint that's all I want to do is just paint  I have two sons and it's time for me to the move on and they're older and they can take care of themselves now so many leaving the area where my sons are sweetheart  the reflection of you  play reflection of you a mind you so much about yourself Who You Are  consistency even when you're sick  I don't assume my kids are right around by listen to him first and then make my decisions after that and I try not to come from an emotional hiding place but I think logically and I put myself in their place before I do it we discuss we communicate happy in my family cuz that's the only way we get along with each other through communication  communicate  my family is severed pretty much so my family my relationship with my family on the reservation is very tight and the rest of the family were all fragmented scattered around the Southwest so it's not very tight at all  I have too many to count  start with my uncle my uncle was like my dad. Me to go away  he watched out for me he told me he taught me hard work at a very young age he also taught me to protect my family  Tommy honor. Me Love  it's a good man  how easy is it for you to get a good night  I don't lie ever had a good night sleep in years so I have to get broken sleep  are dreams the dreams you come through real  get up and go to the bathroom and go back to sleep  my years of fighting and just got up to me  reserved  reserved and I try to find things to distract my brain to think of different ways of doing things  I got rid of TV about 8 months ago so I got rid of that distraction so what I do now is ready to paint a garden or cleaning house washing dishes or get out the walk that's nothing to do a lot of walking out is  anxiety anxious  my anxieties  habits good I have techniques to bring myself down  nothing new  out of the normal  yes  3 years ago around 3  insomnia issues  it was about  2 years ago around there to look it over two years ago I was released from therapy  off the therapist Release Me  what I noticed is I still deal with pictures and emotions  what would I do is now if I really practice hard at taking care of myself and then getting to those places to things that  strike me give me anxious or excited or angry I learn how to work out of it and realize it's not real it's not real  that's just the emotion it's not real so these are the things like no manches and I tell myself and this is really helped me a lot from therapy because it taught me that those emotions and pictures truly aren't real  and that's the therapies helped a lot that mean it's just a change my world  if  around the same time as the PTSD  after years ago  in my dreams when I dream I do  last night  I just dreaming of fighting and then in preparing fighters to fight I wasn't nothing to I build up anxiety dreaming about preparing fighters to fight and then stepping in front of thousands of people and then I always end up fighting in my dreams so it's always what gets me scared in all my dreams is that I should have made the move and finish the fight and I didn't  and so builds anxiety and stressing me that I tend to act out in my sleep  I was real like I was there right like I smell taste feel everything their house there  on this morning driving here talking to my girlfriend  trustworthy  he loves me I love him he's more best friends  a 02 change  I can recall  okay  I got it  just not spending time with my grandparents and in  I think they today issues maybe you know a couple here there that I should have went to the store first or something like that but I mean it's nothing like that  quit thinking you know it all  my loyalty  my trustworthiness  the new art project yesterday  nice  where is Santa Barbara from the film some rocks and some old rock song Someone that made by loving just threw a dump old rocks out of the way and it went through the pile of rocks and I found the soul rock that was in the middle of it and then took a home and now I'm doing art piece on it and for me it was like the thing was totally forgotten about was just considered a rock and now they're sure you'll be sitting in my grand kids table and let's just give me a call like that  what are you most proud of in your life  start starting something that I'm so bad at  then I don't think there's no way I can be good at it and all sudden I get to be better at it so I don't even have to think about it just so good at it that way I could just touch it and feel it and then I think about it these are the things I'm proud of like I like that I like that  accomplishment I guess you can say  her her left clavicle needs adjustment  her clavicle set tired makes it look like she's been in a car accident and she's like this sheet her left shoulder is up higher and it's question so you're off and it's drawing my attention to that so I don't know if you guys noticed that to the other part of it too is the hand motions that she does some of the hand motions are very aggressive in it and wakes it was very distracting in the beginning because she was like  fast moving like my therapist cuz we working with the PTSD issues he that he did everything slowly cuz I said off on quick trigger movements and so like with her hand movements like that. Like this talkin it was distracting in the beginning but besides that everything is just like it's pretty amazing computer but it's and you feel comfortable that is a good thing  yeah yeah
464,male,0,0,alright cool I'm doing good what about you Los Angeles but I couldn't even recited Inglewood  we did I answer your question I don't know  okay  La the murals the ocean what else the people my family is over here so that's the best part  what about you  I would say the smog yeah the air had to be cleaner and yeah  that's what I mean is good people bad people too but yeah for the most part it's all good  yeah I've been in Mexico and the temples and it was in California so yes  traveling like Tina are that's good healthy for the body cleaner blood flow the people culture and stories and then come back you share stories with like your friends  yeah anytime like right now or when  okay so I just one time I was a kid we went out to the temples and it started raining so we just start walking through in like when we get to the top one thing I didn't know before is that the higher you go does the smartest steps get so like people back then had on a smaller feet so what happened was as I went higher towards the temple I had to walk sideways so my feet can measure up to that the steps but once you get up there tonight to you  I am  general education but mainly art yeah I took a lot of art classes  well when I was a kid I scribble and walls with Crayola so I figured you know like it kind of stuck around with me so I just posted it so yeah  my dream job would be to get paid for painting painting art  yeah  yeah pretty simple  it's not so much that it's hard it just requires passion persistence and faith and well you just have to really believe in yourself to yourself the more likely you are able to succeed  I consider myself to be shy and certain time of places but I am also outgoing when like I have the energy so I feel like it's well-balanced you know like I'm shy when it's I guess okay to be shy you know and I'm outgoing when like the need to actually have fun or just explore feels good like if I make sense but yeah  screensaver  yeah  2 hour relax  either well I'm going to say this but I smoke weed so that helps and I like painting painting humans help me relax you know blue on relax me and also green when I use these two colors and make a painting account calms me down  I didn't have a blue shirt yeah  my temper well my thoughts and my thoughts control my emotions and my emotions yeah scream until my temporary getting mad or if I do get mad what will be the outcome you know so control my temper is just like training my thought  the last time I argued with somebody was with my with my father and it was because I wanted to eat food but he wanted me to buy wine so right when the food was ready I was hungry eating you like nope so that kind of frustrated me and the way I handled it was like well I could just eat when I come back and I'm doing him a favor so you know and then after you not to eat and eat in peace so yeah  my family is pretty good my mom and dad have a good relationship and still married and my brothers and sisters we help one another out so that's good it's just yeah it's a good team  a situation I wish I could handle differently would be  that's a good question I mean can I get scenario  okay  situation and kind of differently what you got something I feel like if I'm calm in any situation I could figure it out you know but if it came down to like a Rubik's Cube maybe how to handle the situation would be just buy a feeling I'm feeling making mistakes because I don't make the right mistakes and the right lessons will come after so that's the best way I could answer your question you know yeah  deposit influence pretty much anybody who told me the truth has been a positive influence influence you know like yeah even though it may hurt like all the truth does hurt well they're not trying to be mean that actually  good influences I was in my friends my mom and dad my brother my sister's yeah  we'll see that's the thing like I have I've had some pretty bad experiences with like being at gunpoint and with a knife but at the end of the day with that did was like give me more insight made me more aware and it taught me how to read people a little bit more like dispense things out and also how to avoid situations so even though it was bad and it did kind like scar me a different pair me for like the world you know because it's happened to me when I was like 12 13 years old so if everyday could be exposed to like you know like guns nice and all that stuff so it's it's bad but it's good in a long-term you know because if you get out of that slump it's like nothing else would really phase you because you think you might have been through worse so it's not as bad as you know and  so yeah  the hardest  this one right now I don't feel like answering when I got stuck I like kind of think I was part of it but Hearts decision as far as like life-changing  life changing whether to continue school college or not I kind of chose  to like I went to school but I chose to pursue my own like  like I'm there any more advice can I give myself with people who are already in the field I want to be in so that was a hard choice because there was no guarantee that I would like run into like the right people but I took that chance you know I'm at the right people so  yeah  yeah yeah  how easy is it for you to get a good night  actually really easy I sometimes like I could sleep right now in like 10 minutes you know I just like like soda my air pattern  lately I've been feeling good I've been feeling like I have free will like at this point in time I feel like if I chose a path any path with like my heart I could get there you know but I'm kind of like still deciding if I carry sing in August pass or in the air or should I make my own I don't know that's why I'm at I feel like a free will  oh yeah  ladylike in the past 2 weeks or today  okay yeah you know like  yeah things happen that would change like my feelings and  example right now they just happened right now like  this experience for one is kind of like a shift in my thought because  yeah it's like it's technology you know it's like it's a trip to see how far I like one could take a thought and then make it reality so that's kind of like shifting my thoughts right now this experience this whole experience  yeah  post-traumatic stress disorder no  depression I know how it's like to be depressed but diagnosed by a doctor no  depression  how how it feels  how does depression feel like it feels like it's like a bird in the cage being depression is like being a fish who can't swim in the water have feeling depression is like being A Bird Without Wings pretty much it feels like you're limited but then a thing is to get out of that depression if I get to awaken and change your perspective and focus on  like I would say colors colors help and people talking to people helps  yeah  being depressed  16  I don't know like it could come like it to happen everyday like it's small doses doses so like I could say today you know earlier when I was just by myself I felt a little depressed then what happened I fixed it like a cut up a friend and met up with him and yeah  I mean at this moment I feel pretty happy you know I'm talking to average person is pretty cool and yeah right now if you're happy  sometimes hard headed like you would try to teach me a certain investment whether it's art or just like in my character and yeah he just described me as like like like Listen by the same thing he'll still do what he wants to do but it's so pretty much like I don't know  yeah I mean that's what he tells me but your overall good person  I just exercised my diet food my food intake and yeah  health  I would say when I was like in middle school or in elementary little bit too but yeah it would be was it would either be about  will Pumas my heart like something and I thought it was good and then someone else be like all you know that looks kind of like like trash and then I'll be like oh damn I could accept and be like yeah it does kind of look and then fix it or why would do back then we'll be like damn you know you're going to do well and I thought and then just like stay there for a bit and then eventually I'll come out of it but yeah you should use bone people's words  and ideas that yeah  yeah I said it  regret yeah I got a couple things I regret  like what well sometimes I feel like I should have completed the whole university thing but I mean at the same time I feel like if I really wanted to go I would have gone  so yeah that's kind of regret my head  10 or 20 years ago would be on seek spiritual well-being you know learn how to handle your thoughts to your thoughts I will teach myself pick the people you surround yourself with because that definitely has a major influence in your environment Street events you experience and as far as your overall happiness  yeah  among other things but yeah  I'm most proud of right now is my paintings I'm proud of that because like I feel like depends on releasing are things that no one else could duplicate you know it's like it's one of a kind of Nikes is there you know is Sazon signature something so yeah I'm pretty happy about that  yeah thank you  are you thinking  alright bye  yeah

in and getting a different perspective um in two thousand eight i studied abroad in brazil and that was about four months and i was in bahia which is in the north and um let's see the program consisted of learning the history learning the language and staying with a homestay family um i've always wanted to travel and i chose brazil because um they have an afro-brazilian population or a large afro-brazilian population which i really wanted to learn more about and i think the history and the cullture is really interesting um i think taking a bus by myself to a remote beach and just navigating on my own and um figuring out where to go yeah right now i'm getting my master's in social work <laughter> dream job <sigh> i think to um consult about um mental health and how to um how to intervene effectively with different cultures and doing research and consulting work and getting to travel um basically that those would be the main characteristics i think that's a false dichotomy but i do consider myself shy but at the same time outgoing in the sense that i push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone and i'm determined to do what it takes to become successful <laughter> um i listen to music and just lay on my bed and um i guess you could say do mindfulness and really just take my mind off of things also breathing exercises which i'm learning more about um as well as exercise pretty good i don't get angry a lot um so as far as angry temperament i'm pretty good at that hmm um mm what month is this may probably two months ago and i argued via text message <laughter> so it's not really intense arguing but i guess you could call it arguing in a sense over whether or not i should be forgiven for something that i thought was minor um with a friend i've had for a few years i felt anxious um sad and angry um yeah those are the main emotions i know them because i think i'm pretty in touch with my emotions and being able to identify them and then i'll notice the physical uh manifestations of emotions like if i if my heart's racing or if i'm getting sweaty if i'm <sigh> if my breathing is more shallow i'll know i'm anxious i'll know something's bothering me hmm <laughter> that i wish i had handled differently i guess related to this argument um i went out one night and got a little too intoxicated and <clears throat> ended up calling a person for a ride home but that really upset that person and i know that it wasn't such a big deal but i wish i hadn't have let myself get to that point um it it impacted a relationship and i also felt really bad about what i did mm <clears throat> hardest decision <sigh> wow um probably deciding what type of graduate program to go into i briefly went to law school and decided not to do that so afterwards well after dropping out i had to really rethink what it is that i wanted to do and what i wanted to dedicate my life to go into debt for spend a lot of energy on um <sigh> i think by recognizing what i don't want to do and doing a lot of research on program requirements and the jobs that you can get after completing a program <sigh> mm <sigh> i have to think <sigh> oh <laughter> um revolving around the same person i spoke of earlier it was a dating relationship and a few years ago we had a falling out over his treatment of me and it involved another person and i wish i could get that out of my mind um <laughter> <laughter> i have a pretty good relationship with my mom she lives in the bay area i didn't grow up with her but i've gotten um closer to her as an adult uh we talk pretty regularly with my dad i grew up with him mostly he lives in atlanta and um we don't talk as much but we are we have a pretty decent relationship it's not really that contentious or anything and i'm an only child so i don't have siblings i don't have a large family um so in general i'm not really that close to family um one person is my mentor who i met in two thousand five and she's a judge and i met her when i was in community college and she really opened my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that i would be able to achieve certain things <sigh> pretty easy well it's easy for me to sleep what's not easy is getting up because usually i do not forward <f> look forward to what i have to do that day and the thought of it is you know just makes me wanna stay in bed also i wake up pretty tired not really feeling refreshed <clears throat> i think just <sigh> self-talk about how what i have to do isn't that bad or that the things that i'm doing now are gonna end pretty soon with the end of the school year um trying to think of things that i can look forward to in the week um also listening to music and browsing the internet kinda gets my mind going <sigh> feeling <sigh> uh wow um feeling emotionally drained on some ways and at the same time feeling like i've accomplished a lot and that i've grown so a mix of ambivalence and feeling drained and a mixture of feeling accomplished and proud at the same time no i haven't yes in two thousand six the convergence of a lot of stressful factors um i was out of touch with my mom i started um well i had transferred to a university that was pretty rigorous and just all those changes going on really um exacerbated  things that were already there depressive tendencies that were already there and it got to a point where i just felt really overwhelmed yes i do yes i notice i'm better able to accept my emotions and not judge them and also identify them i'm <sigh> able to think <th> think differently about things that happened maybe look at things in a more positive light and also identify the areas i need to work on and the underlying issues in those areas <clears throat> mm <sigh> um this past weekend i reconnected with some old friends and it was really good to see them and be back in touch again <laughter> um <sigh> people have different takes on on me i don't have one best friend but i think people would describe me as very um analytical sensitive intelligent intellectual um i wish that i did not or wait i wish i was better able to cope with my anxiety and depression which i'm working on and <sigh> i wish that i had more energy <laughter> start going to therapy now <laughter> um but yeah i really would and also to what how old am i twenty eight ten years ago eighteen okay so graduating from high school i would <sigh> tell myself to pick up some more job skills so that i wouldn't have to struggle as much in the future and to seek out mentors to get a clearer um idea of what i wanted to do as a career um i think the fact that i'm in grad school and coming from the background that i that i come from low socio-economic status and just pushing through challenges to get here <laughter> you're welcome bye
426,male,1,20,<sync. yes i'm alright south l_a um the weather the women the opportunities that's about it racism police brutality injustice that's it mm no not much of a exploring type of person um psychology mhm um it was one of the classes i excelled in the most so i decided to change it from business to psychology yeah yes no to own my own record label um it it's moderately hard but you know take it one day at a time just i guess you know stay focused a little bit of both um i tend to be shy in um situations i'm not comfortable with or i'm new to and i'm outgoing in places i'm more comfortable with yeah <laughter> um turn the lights down low and listen to soft music mhm i'm getting better over the years um i think i'm pretty decent now compared to how i used to be yes ma'am um due to the lack of i guess you could say controlling my emotions i have uh gotten incarcerated sent to prison yeah mm i'm not sure uh i don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision i've made in my life um it was probably a few days ago with the girl i was talking to and i was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness yeah uh frustrated because um you know uh you you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect you know the same effort by the other person when you're in a relationship and at the same time when you when you have expectations sometimes you kinda set yourself up for failure so you know i guess i'm just learning there's a lot of situations i would've handled differently um probably the most recent was uh i had gotten into a physical <phy> a physical altercation with an inmate when i was incarcerated and that made me that's what sent me to prison and and i had to do a lot more time and um if i handled it differently i probably would've never went to prison i probably would've been home a lot sooner than i originally happen yeah mm there are several events i wish i could erase from my memory um probably uh my first girlfriend um she did something really uh extreme it wasn't necessary in my eyes and it and it cost <co> it could've cost me my life i think that that that's a recurring thought that i i wish i could completely erase from my memory along with the good memories as well um a few you few fights uh i guess you could say shoot outs um getting jumped getting robbed you know those things i think those inhibit me i guess to to explore certain areas of life that i'm not comfortable with so those are the feww things that it'd be nice if i could erase it completely yeah <sigh> hurting people that didn't need to be hurt emotionally especially um a few women in my life or in my past um probably putting my mother through certain things that she didn't have to go through along with my close friends and family as well um used to be rocky growing up but as i got older and matured and the certain experiences that i've been through kind of brought me closer to my family so now it's it it's pretty decent it's it's pretty decent mm i would say my mother um yeah my mother um well she she uh she had her share of experiences negative and positive um i admire her the struggles she's been through um she she she uh experienced difficult economic hardships growing up but that didn't stop her um from raising a son at a young age finishing school getting her master's and just just overall being a a good person and she also battled mental health issues as well and um probably not the best of family that she could've been raised with so she so she's kinda of like a a inspiration to to me and other people as well so i would say my mother mm it's not easy so yeah it's not easy i couldn't tell you i i i've always had sleeping issues um i usually just take uh like over the counter sleep medication or nyquil but it makes you drowsy the next morning so it's like it's a negative effect really yeah the medication <medi> i don't know shit i don't know but i just stopped taking it 'cause i didn't like feeling drowsy not good at all um yeah i mean i recently got released from prison not too long ago uh i'm older now and a lot more responsibilities and i feel like my life is not where it's supposed to be i feel like i could've made a lot more better decisions in my life you know sometimes feeling sorry for myself and just things that i've been through and the whole nine yards so yeah it's all good yeah so true yes <sniffle> about two and a half three years ago <deep breath> <sigh> myself i um i was i was just tired of not i don't know i guess school kind of made me seek help because i started to understand myself how my brain works um you know so i decided to seek help maybe to better my life yeah you could say that yes i am yes yes i do actually i do mm better decision making um better tools to reflect on choices um how to control uh certain situations better yeah um <sniffle> well instead of just always reacting on emotion no matter what kind of emotion it is i step back and and and i assess the situation you know to see what's what's the best way to to react towards the situation and by doing that it has made me more mature emotionally more mature and just has a positive outcome <laughter> um i was lying next to a beautiful woman who who cared about me and the feeling was mutual so that was probably the most happy oh my goodness spontaneous um outgoing sometimes a little crazy um fun that's about it nothing um like i said earlier just you know hurting the the few women that were in my life my past and my friends and family that's about it oh shit uh school is really important um how i carry myself the people who i surround myself with and what i choose to do in my free time those are the few things i would tell myself good music um a good game of basketball um sex um i like going out i like going to parties um social gatherings where everyone's friendly and and there's no drama that's what i like dancing beautiful women a couple drinks that's about it um i guess not not necessarily giving up and and um just just i don't know just keep going just just not giving up really yeah mhm bye bye

was like okay well this is the problem and it i just wanted help because it just when your mind is after you like that's like it's just awful to have your mind taking control of you like that  yeah  yeah it's hard  um yeah yeah i definitely always thought i had a problem i always thought something was like really wrong um i just always like kinda nervous around people like i never can really like look anybody in the eye 'cause i'm just so nervous my eyes are always kind of like racing and i um would have sweats if i was in the situation um that reminded me of the situation like i just try to

trying to think of what i'm most proud of um  i  think i'm most proud of like the fact that i am able to you know not be like well i mean most people i know they like deny that they have a problem and i'm proud that i can actually like you know be a person who can realize okay i have a problem and i need help but a lot of the people i know they don't take medication they're untreated and um they just don't wanna get any help and i'm glad to get help because i don't wanna feel that way and i wanna get help for the problem instead of doing that  oh gosh there's a lot i regret yeah there's a lot um i regret you know uh drug abuse you know but that's part of you know the p_t_s_d i regret um a lot uh mistakes you know relationships stuff like that  wow um i would've told myself to um i guess

drowsy not good at all um yeah i mean i recently got released from prison not too long ago uh i'm older now and a lot more responsibilities and i feel like my life is not where it's supposed to be i feel like i could've made a lot more better decisions in my life you know sometimes feeling sorry for myself and just things that i've been through and the whole nine yards so yeah it's all good yeah so true yes <sniffle> about two and a half three years ago <deep breath> <sigh> myself i um i was i was just tired of not i don't know i guess school kind of made me seek help because i started to understand myself how my brain works um you know so i decided to seek help maybe to better my life yeah you could say that yes i am yes yes i do actually i do mm better decision making um better tools to reflect on choices um how to control uh certain situations better yeah um <sniffle> well instead of just always reacting on emotion no matter what kind of emotion it is i step back and and and i assess the situation you know to see what's what's the best way to to react towards the situation and by doing that it has made me more mature emotionally more mature and just has a positive outcome <laughter> um i was lying next to a beautiful woman who who cared about me and the feeling was mutual so that was probably the most happy oh my goodness spontaneous um outgoing sometimes a little crazy um fun that's about it nothing um like i said earlier just you know hurting the the few women that were in my life my past and my friends and family that's about it oh shit uh school is really important um how i carry myself the people who i surround myself with and what i choose to do in my free time those are the few things i would tell myself good music um a good game of basketball um sex um i like going out i like going to parties um social gatherings where everyone's friendly and and there's no drama that's what i like dancing beautiful women a couple drinks that's about it um i guess not not necessarily giving up and and um just just i don't know just keep going just just not giving up really yeah mhm bye bye
337,female,1,10,yeah i'm doing okay how are you doing i'm originally from like a suburb <su> a suburb of l_a from the san gabriel valley i like the diversity i like the vibe of the city i've lived other places and it's just not as happy here i feel like i can really thrive here so i just like l_a like all the things that are so close together then there's a lot of interesting things that totally different parts of the city just miles away from each other uh don't like the traffic don't like all the cars but i can live with it i mean there's not that much i don't like i studied music um vocal performance i studied music technology things like that yes right now um i sing in an opera company but my i do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the l_a opera so i do have a day job i work at a call center that caters mostly to performers and actors and things like that and it's really good because if i get a call i can call in and change my shift very easily so it's actually a pretty good gig and i do some uh technology gigs sometimes you know it's do some recording some live sound stuff but i'm kinda wanna get away from that do some video work sometimes but again i wanna get away from that i wanna go back to the  because i find that performing more is more interesting i like being talent more than i like being crew <laughter> so i kinda wanna get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what i wanna do with my life sometimes i mean per my personal life yeah so i do have a shell that i put out there to deal with people but if i'm at home you know i'd kinda rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever talk to family   don't really have too many close friends <clears throat> but yeah you know i'd rather keep to myself uh moderately close to the family that i have left i've actually lost a lot of family in the last ten years or so but like thank you <laughter> but like uh my i'm close to my husband and you know i've got couple of cousins i talk to and my aunt that i have an aunt that i talk to a bit but it's not like we're interacting every day close together  but it's somewhat close mostly i sing or i read or i write or just hang out and try to clear my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesn't work but i try to do that and try to just clear everything and see what starts coming back in and sometimes <ss> sometimes that works sometimes it doesn't but mostly creating things um contacting my family some <so> you know through facebook or whatever works but mostly in my free time i create things i'd like to travel more i like to travel by car a lot um i mean my idea of like having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip and i like to travel more um i would love to travel for work things or whatever but i don't get as much of an opportunity as i would like to to travel seeing <see> uh particularly traveling by car seeing like the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know feeling the vibrations of the area change  i like just seeing what's out there seeing and i know that there's a bigger world outside of  where i am and where i live and my world and i like to see that but i like to leave that too and go back to my own world <laughter> <laughter> <clears throat> um let's see xxx a trip that i like to take is to make the drive from here to nevada whether i go all the way to vegas or just go to state line um my cousin and i would take what we call exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway so we'd take those we'd just   sort of impromptu with like <li> a day or two notice just move things around just take off so those are actually trips that i i like making <mak> 'cause i take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight just small short trips that aren't very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how um you know the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas  so close to home but not but not close to home close to home but uh still a world away so that 'cause i don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever but that's just little things that kinda put things back in perspective and and clear my head and things like that i mean 'cause there's sort of a sense of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway so i i like i like doing that the last time that happened was may of last year that's the last time i was able to do that we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who's ten years younger than i am and we kinda grew up like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland empire which is where they live so they kinda took me on a last hurrah and we drove up to vegas and looked around and came back 'cause i actually lived in vegas for awhile but i didn't like it so they kinda i showed <show> showed them some of the locals sites around there and we came back and was you know an overnight trip but we were driving the entire time <laughter> so it was kind of an interesting uh things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals people who can't fight back and they're mean to them just because they can't fight back   and i actually like to see people who are strong <st> as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate or what have you so i think that's one thing that's makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason you know not people <pe> for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it just that kinda really just makes me mad when i'm annoyed i'll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me then i'll wind up lashing out somehow either   you know verbally just cutting 'em with a quip or you know i mean i i rarely just i rarely will yell at somebody but i'll try to you know if i'll try to walk away and defuse it if that doesn't work then i'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me <laughter> that usually works  not in like legal trouble or anything because usually i'll find a way to get them to leave me alone um so there's not really like big trouble but 'cause i think 'cause it's it it is off-putting and it's not expected <exp> the expected reaction and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction 'cause i know that will work and get people away from me so it's not really in trouble and if  it's is trouble it's usually trouble that it's from their the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because it's usually a situation i can get out of  so as long as they leave me alone you know i don't i i'll walk away from it uh the last time i argued with somebody like person <per> like a person <per> like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my uh the last thing i can think of was i argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law 'cause she's got dementia and so we one of the reasons we came out here from the inland empire was to take care of her 'cause she won't go anywhere but l_a i mean she is like hardcore angelino like you know we we know we are the we're that in our nature but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere <laughter> but um so we came out here to take care of her  and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is 'cause she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process  but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what she wants 'cause he's a mama's boy like i am i'm a mama's girl even though i've lost my mom like four years ago i'm still a mama's girl and i'll still <st> and i still and i know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much and that's what they want so you wanna get it for 'em and because you know they you know that happened when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it  and you wanna do that for them now like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about somebody you feel deserves it but it's kinda dangerous for her you know and i don't want things <thi> something to happen to her yet i want her to remain who she is for as long as she can 'cause i know it the disease that she has is gonna erase who she is eventually and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her twenty four hour medically trained care but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves 'cause it's not that bad but it's getting where she really shouldn't <shou> has no business living by herself anymore so the solution right now is he stays there most the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do i handle the outside things i run the errands i take her to the store things like that he does the day to day things makes sure she has <ha> she eats makes sure she you know has clean clothes things like that so i mean it's a partnership it's a it's a dual effort it's very much a dual effort but i would like her to move in with us so that was that's like a source of it's not really like yelling screaming argument but lively discussion <laughter> you know than debate meh it's not insurmountable i mean life's not gonna be easy ever and if it is that's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you so as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life it's not gonna be easy but you deal with it and you you move on uh the most positive influence i think have been probably my mother and my grandmother 'cause my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually gave me a lot of confidence and but were realistic about it so i mean i think i have sort of a realistic sort of a downer temperment <laughter> to myself but they but they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something i can't get over and that you know life's gonna go on you know my mom would say to me when you're forty you're forty whether you're working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life and i think that was a big influence on how i lived have how i've lived my life since she's passed   i regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because i think it may have clouded some of my decisions now i do have underlying conditions and everybody in my family is diabetic and i didn't take care of that when she was the last year of her life 'cause i was too busy wanting to get her home my focus was to get her home so i didn't eat right i didn't take my insulin right um i wound up making myself insulin resistant that that year just 'cause my blood sugar was so high for eh like a year eating just horrible foods when i did eat so it really took a toll and i really actually made myself very sick  and i'm wondering well if i didn't if i would've taken care of myself and i had my head on completely straight and my my vision <vi> my vision and my thoughts weren't completely <complete> weren't clouded would i have made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed 'em and when she needed me to be to step in and make the decisions for her because she  uh wound up having a health catastrophe 'cause she had kidney well she had kidney damage that wound up being kidney failure and her health insurance provider missed that so she wound up having sort of this whole catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down she wound up having a stroke at like fifty one she had had a small stroke and it just kinda went down from there so i'm thinking well if i didn't if i had taken care of better care of myself would i have been able to take better care of her and i know there wasn't anything i would've been able to do to prevent her death but what if i if i would i have been be able to make it easier on her if i would have taken care of myself and that's like one huge regret that i have oh i know i am <laughter> but xxx it's my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that i care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and i know other people i can't really direct them into my own vision because they're their own individual beings and they can't you know be what i want them to be and i know they're not going to be but i still have you know my ideals and i want the way i want everything to go and i want everybody that i care about to be happy and to be able too  fit into my life in a way in the best way possible but i know 'cause they're other beings and i know i'm not gonna be able to do that for them and they're not gonna be able to do that for me but it's still my ideals <laughter> so i have to sometimes have to look at it and go well is this what i want because i want it or what is what they want and what's their <thei> is it their decision or mine and it's usually it's theirs and i know it's theirs so i so if you really care about somebody you're just gonna support them and go with them but  it's still kinda hard <laughter> for for me and know i gotta get over it um ten or twenty years ago probably to have been more assertive in starting my own life because i wound taking care of my mother i mean she got sick literally the weekend i graduated from college <laughter> and i had a job lined up and i had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her and i think i would've been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside  the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about ten years so i think i i probably would've done that um but i tell myself just do that you keep who you are and learn to separate your you who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family to keep a sense of of yourself that's probably what i would've and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself that's probably the advance advice of what i would give myself    ten years ago <laughter> no no no but probably 'cause i haven't gone to a doctor about it <laughter> 'cause i don't wanna know and i mean it's not i know there've been times in my life where i've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it but i'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment and of it gets <ge> um after my mother had died i mean it'd been this long battle for a year that we lost and i didn't know if i if i was to blame for that it's like logically i knew i wasn't but how could i convince myself of that um two weeks after she died i wound up with pulmonary embolisms in one in each lung because i didn't take care of myself for a year and i figured oh i'm thirty years old if you know whatever i do to myself i can get over no <laughter> turns out no <laughter> but um i mean i wound up having to take more medication because of that uh it's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to get out of that depression 'cause so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden i didn't it's like the rug was pulled out my like bottom fell out of my world after that so that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression um i almost got divorced because of it because i just didn't want anything anymore  so and i was i being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point and i started getting very distant from him just pushing everything away just you know figuring well what am i gonna do with the rest of my life now and it it's been a fight you know you mean there times when no i couldn't get up just stay in bed and sleep all day you know but then realizing that when my mother died i had four cats to look after two are mine two are hers and so i wound up adopting the two that were hers i mean well they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you know own own supplies i took that responsibility of doing it for them so that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not i was gonna get up and provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go without taking care of myself but they couldn't they didn't you know so they eh they actually got me up and and made me go out and face things even though i didn't want to didn't just didn't just kinda wanted to curl up and die but that would've been my choice not theirs and they i mean what would happen to them if i wasn't there to take care of them they would've been you know sent to a shelter or whatever probably  and maybe they would've not been readopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for  for me i mean for me making selfish decisions   so it's like i need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed <laughter> so <s> and that's actually been a motivating factor is to to 'cause i've figured out that if it was just me i'd be able to live without a lot of stuff i mean i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it wouldn't be a big deal i wouldn't care   as long as i was doing what i wanted with my life but i have a family to look after now  so i have to go out and do things  you know i i have to go out and look for legitimate work you know day you know day job i have to you know   but i'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what i wanna do with my life but yet i have to take care of my family so i'm   been working on on a balance of the two very <laughter> but it's worth it i mean  it would be very i'd have a lot less things to worry about if i just lived in my car and said forget it <laughter>  but keeping a residence down paying bills things like that  it's it's difficult but you have to do it you know if you want you want anything <anyth> if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that  and i and and i know that  but  it it gets hard sometimes you do wanna give up  but then  it's like well what's the alternative  i mean i don't think i could live a comfortable life  'cause if i did i wouldn't do anything <laughter> i have to be slightly uncomfortable or i'm not gonna do anything with myself i'm just gonna  be content to just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with my cats or whatever  and i wouldn't get anything done  uh very  anxious and nervous and i mean what if  i don't find  enough you know enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if um  you know what what if i can't   keep a semblance of stability in my life and it it's actually hard work to be stable <laughter> and i know it's hard work to be stable but  what you know it's just eh a lot of what ifs  and and i don't think it's things that haven't happened and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened and i know that  but it still happens <ha> it still creeps in  so that's actually  a source of  anxiety  but then you try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it  but i i i know it it's a cycle and i'll go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do to saying okay what is the fundamental thing i need to take of here  i mean what <wha> what is just extraneous and what can <c> what can what is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue  and so  figure out how to figure things out that way and then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit but then something'll pop up and the what ifs will come up again  mm i'll have to  uh  figure it out again <laughter> but i know it's a cycle i know um what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it   you get over it pretty quickly you get through it  the last time i felt really happy i don't know zz um i  huh <laughter> that's a good question that actually <ac> that actually surprisingly stumped me  because i do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much sometimes just kinda eh in the middle um really like overjoyously happy i don't know  i i'm not i can't think of <o> of when that happened i don't know you don't know  perceptions of other people i mean  probably as somebody who  oddly enough somebody who is laid back and you know  handles things as they come but i don't see myself as that   at all and it's a it probably that i can think on my feet and i'm not afraid to  hussle my butt off and do whatever i have to to survive and get things done  um that  and i can do it creatively and i try to  strive for balance  probably  probably the best things about me <laughter>  that i'm doing basically what i want with my life which even though it's not all easy it's not  um you know i'm not financially well off or anything it's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives 'cause i have an aunt that i really don't talk to  who and the reason why i don't talk to her is because she's always miserable i mean she's got a career that she  it's more of a job that she fell into  'cause my older aunt uh loves animals but didn't wanna be a veterinarian so she became a dog groomer  and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time   but her hands <ha> you know she started getting arthritis in her hands and she had um the actually my cousin's father went and kinda stole all the money from her business so she lost her business   and she kinda she retired early 'cause between that and the arthritis she wound up retiring early  she employed my younger aunt who was still a dog groomer but she hates it   and it's like change your life if you hate your life so much change it  and the thing <thi> the thing i'm most proud of is  yeah i'm not as financially well off as she is but i'm doing what i want with my life you know i can  be creative i can have creative people around me people who i actually like to talk to around me  people i actually like in my life and  be happy with that  and i see a lot of people who aren't  and it it gives me a sense of of maybe a a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say i'm not like that  and i'm actually doing what i want even though there's sacrifices i'm still fundamentally doing what i want with my life now thank you <laughter> okay  thank you <laughter> goodbye
321,female,1,20,okay my arms  chat with you  and then she'll let you know when you guys are done  okay alright then  yeah  I'm okay  I'm Chicago Illinois  at my husband's work was here  + 84  it was not easy for me it took about three years  I'm just a move I moved away from my family so I was uncomfortable I didn't know anyone here and even though I did make friends I just felt out of place  not as often as I would like I used to go back at least once a year but in the last few years that's diminish so I would say like every 3 years  the weather  I love the weather the beach you know as I've been here as long as I have the people have some nice people here  of the people some of the people yeah also I would say the economy  it's very difficult to make it here in Los Angeles  business in computer graphics  I'm not working in it right now  I'm working in retail  I just couldn't find work and so I had to settle for doing that for right now  it's very tough  I would like to be a human resource representative  no  I like to talk to people too much and when I understand right I know a lot about a subject I can go on and on about it and I'm interested in finding out about people if I'm sitting next to somebody else strike up a conversation with them just to find out who they are and  just so you know I'd like to talk to people I enjoy it  I'm quiet  rude people people that harm children in the elderly that makes me very angry War  I control my temper I don't have a problem with that I just get quiet when I feel angry and I try to think before I act  the last time we argued with someone was about a month ago and it was with my daughter and I was arguing with her over her therapy and she has cancer and dumb she wasn't telling me enough she wasn't giving me enough information and so that made me very angry I was frustrated and angry  yeah it was very hard  no  watching your children fail when they're trying hard or seeing that they can hurt themselves and trying to prepare them for that when they won't listen to your advice. I feel like sometimes they need to trust me more  the love of my children  when I was stop playing with my granddaughter and there was about a month ago  very excited and happy and just all my cares were gone I wasn't thinking about anything except for having fun with her so it was a good time  yeah it's the best  no  yes  it was over 5 years ago  I couldn't function I couldn't drive I couldn't sleep I couldn't eat at my I couldn't do anything I was completely  shut down I felt like I felt like I was looking out a window and in life was going on outside that window and I was just stuck behind the glass III couldn't participate  I knew something wasn't right  but I  lately I've been feeling depressed  I haven't had a good night sleep in a year I would say my regular pattern is to maybe sleep in an hour up to 3 hour intervals and they just keep waking up but I never quite get into a deep sleep  groggy and I have no energy  it's very hard because it's so difficult to work it's difficult to concentrate I make mistakes and I forget a lot  yes I do  yes  no I'm not in therapy right now  I could not afford to continue  I'm sorry what  I'm not sure  yes  I I feel more relaxed and  I I feel like some of my worries are lifted from me I have a I can think clearer because I am using the tools that I've learned through therapy  my children  I don't know  friendly  I think it's just horrible  I feel that the children are so neglected today and it's not the fault of the parents I think that dumb I think that we as a society we forgot that it takes a village to raise a child and nobody wants to pitch in no one wants to help anymore no one's helping their neighbor and it's very sad  I don't know  I'm eating dinner with my family  I regret not spending enough time on my education  I had children very young  so I needed to yeah I needed to take care of them  I'm sure I could have  to seek help  my grandparents  I'm just they introduced me to church and just you know letting me play at their home and play in their Garden it just showed me a lot of love and and I felt like I was cared for  no  not listening to music watching funny program on TV  going to school working  go to dinner with a friend  over a year ago  my friend  do work  very close  you're welcome  bye  okay
467,male,0,0,yeah I'm okay with it  I feel pretty good little nervous  because I've never done anything like this before that's why  from Ohio Cincinnati  two months ago two and a half months  I was just looking for  wanted to be in a new environment  oh yeah I'm ecstatic  very happy  I took a few weeks just to get adjusted  cuz I don't know it  the weather is probably the best thing  yeah I know  been other than that pretty much the same as everywhere else I've been  it's nothing I don't really like about la  since you know the weather is the best part of it  I like to travel somewhat I haven't travelled a lot of my life but over the past year-and-a-half I've done done quite a bit of traveling  seeing different places different people new people new faces  new places  but she lasts will last summer I spent the summer in Cleveland doing the urban farming  in the city  I stayed at a hospital the first hospital in Cleveland  and I was at doing program with the  and it was basically we would go to different Urban Farms throughout the city and volunteer  about 20 25 hours a week  oh yeah  really a spur-of-the-moment type of thing  wanted to try something different something I've never done before  and farming is one of those things that you know most people would never try  cuz of a you know cuz of a certain stigma that comes along with it  and you know I just thought it would be fun and interesting to do something like that  what in the urban farming or in general  Urban farming  how do I guess  I don't know just just the overall experience is going you know eating and going to the farmers markets and eating all the fresh food and just send the difference in  you know how fresh natural food tasted you know as opposed to the foodie by the grocery store  yeah it is really this  I was I took two semesters of a college and I was undecided so I was just taking General classes  my dream job  it's my dream job with the D  anything that involves I don't know how like a specific dream job or anything that involves nature just being outside I would like to I wouldn't mind being like a like a forest ranger or something like that  as long as I have you know yeah  consider myself more shy  don't like don't know why it's just the way it is  I read  listen to music  a draw  watch movies stuff like that  I think I'm pretty good at it  I think yeah  wow  yeah I can't remember the last time I hear argument with someone  I don't know  again I don't know because  I don't  dwell on things that happened in the past  maybe whether or not to come to California I guess that was a hard decision  well  I don't know I've been thinking about it you know moving to a new place for a long time  and I guess  hardest part of the decision was  thinking weather  whether or not I will be secure or not you know what I mean just going to a new place we don't know anyone  kind of  are you really don't know what's going to happen  so  there was a lot of  you know fear not in that decision should I go to a place where I don't know anyone I don't I'm not familiar with the area you know only only perception of a hat that I have of this area's you know what I've seen on it and media media and TV  so you know yeah I guess that was the hardest hardest decision that I can think of  I guess so  nothing absolutely nothing  yeah  nothing  I don't feel guilty about anything  relationship with my family  I'm not really close to my family  I guess the person  I'm closest to as my mom but you know I don't you know I never really talked to her much  I don't really know my dad that well so you know  guess my grandmother  yeah she yes she's  she's very  how should I say it  she's very to The Thinker I put it like that like she's very insightful so  you look so her  for a lot of advice because she's been through a lot through a lot in her life  I feel like she you know she's been through a lot so she understands a lot so let you know  she's a very positive influence  very easy  maybe unsure  I would say  because  right now I really don't know  what direction I want to go in with my life  and it's been a lot of confusion with that  but you know it's not  it's not something that overly affects me but you know it's always a thought in the back of my mind felt feels like somehow  maybe I'm running out of time  I know that's not like that's not it that's not a realistic thought because  I don't see how you could ever run out of time but  yeah I guess yeah  just general not knowing what I want  but I know like how do I cope with that  how do I cope with that  I don't know I just do a lot of thinking a lot of soul-searching  it's not hard I mean I mean  it's like I can't say it's hard because it's one of those things that I feel like it's necessary  and  you know certain things in life you just you're forced to face  so it's harder to I think it's harder to avoid those type of things  no  no  no  today  when I talk when I talk to my friend earlier  awesome  how would my best friend describe me  I guess you would say I'm quiet  if you describe me as a nice guy  insightful  Goofy  no I don't really think like that  no  10 or 20 years ago I guess I will tell myself to  stick with whip what stick with what I love  did a  acting Workshop  and numb  I don't know if I've always been interested mine  and I decided why not no try it so you like it  what am I most proud of  like an event or an accomplishment  cuz I pride myself on being independent  bye

405,female,1,17,essential let you know and then you can let me know okay thanks  thanks  go ahead and move his cord behind you didn't get any way  hi hello  are you okay with this  yes  okay not too bad  I'm from Chicago South Side  I'm back in 1978 when I was 18  lately not much maybe once every two or three years  compared to the letter A  it's totally different you know horrible weather and  it's just a whole different atmosphere  let's see my mother had moved to Africa  I graduated from high school and I had a friend down here so I just thought well let me try la  very easy actually yeah I loved it from the moment I got off the airplane  number one the weather son is very important to me so I love the weather  I don't know just kind of a more laid-back atmosphere variety  of people  and now it's my my Homebase you know my friends that are family  that's how I like my family is here now  I guess the small hug earthquakes  traffic  just basic things like that really  I don't currently but I did throughout my life I travel quite a lot  I just seeing seeing other cultures and seeing more history and meeting people and  just fun at the fun of it as well  let's see what one trip I went to England  Ireland and Scotland and France all in you know one trip  so that was a nice variety  I guess you could say probably skiing in val de saire France  that was fun I'm glad I got to do that  that's great  do you consider yourself more shy  I'm kind of shy by Nature I've tried to grow out of being shy so I'm not fully shy but I was always an extremely shy child  but now here in Culver City this is my environment and I I guess you could say I'm not really shy and in my hometown of Culver City  I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got  to relax I like to just curl up in my bed and read my book take a nap watch TV sometimes on the couch in the living room just you know stay at home and kind of vegetate  pretty good yeah my tempers pretty level  probably with my husband  and  I can't remember the moment what it was about  okay  tell me about your relationship with you  well when you say my family do you mean  my family from childhood or my current family  okay well I guess my current family comes to mind I have two daughters and my relationships pretty good it's okay with them but they're teenagers which you know going they're going through a lot of hormones and they can be kind of bitchy and  and but I have hope that you know they'll grow out of bed and soon someday we'll have a really good relationship  and then there's the husband which  like I guess I could face soon-to-be-ex-husband hopefully soon we need to get a divorce but we're still together due to financial reasons  and yeah yeah so that that's not good relationship with the husband but  but since we have determined that we need to divorce  we don't expect anything out of each other so we don't argue as much so that's good  well  I guess our marriage  I wish I had noticed early on that  you know it was like way off from what I thought it was  how do you say oh my God  hardest decision  I guess leaving my first husband that was pretty hard  well you know we were married and I wasn't content I guess you could say and  I kind of just gave up on our relationship and now that I look back I think it's because  I want children and he would have been happy to never have any and so since I didn't have a father it was very important that I create children with someone who really wanted to be a father and so I was kind of at an age where I needed to start thinking about having children yet I was with someone who really was not into it so that I think that's one maybe the core reason why I was not content and I just felt like this marriage isn't going to work n so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not want to break up and  and I had to leave him because I just wasn't happy and that was that was very hard cuz  yeah  felt like I was hurting him which which I was him he survived he got over and now he's married with two kids but it was hard to leave him  tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from your memory  something I wish I could erase from my memory have to think about that  I'm sure there's something well  yeah there's some  I guess it'd be nice to erase from my memory a recent I'm not resend but an event in my  recent adulthood here in Culver City where one of my best friends  betrayed me by back years ago when my husband first got into real estate she and her family were growing and they really need a larger home and  we just assumed that you know that they would use my husband as their agent supposed to sell their current home current at the time and purchase a new home  and as it turned out they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent and yeah that was devastating  I don't think I've ever been betrayed like that so I wish I could erase that not cuz now you know this was back when the kids were really young  and  my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was let's say  6 Maybe  maybe five anyway her and my best friend's daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other we were pregnant together and they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we run into them in the neighborhood are they run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were just you know like two peas in a pod even those her their moms weren't talking to each other anymore so now they're 13 and 14 and they're in middle school together and they're still very connected in fact she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl and it's just a little awkward you know cuz now these girls are becoming really good friends  your friends and yet I still have this  bad memory of what her  her mom did to to me  that was about 1:10  about 8 years ago  I tried it I try to ignore it and put it out of my head which have been able to  in recent years  but obviously it still comes up  anyway that was that  not that easy I do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time I wake up and can't get back to sleep but or I finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up you know that that difficult thing  well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom and then  you know it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then I wake up again to go to the bathroom  so I guess that's the trigger as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there I don't know I think there's just too much on my mind running through my mind and the day I feel like I haven't accomplished enough during the day so  it's hard for me to just go to sleep when I'm supposed to guess  well I'm kind of used to it now so I just go on to the day probably looking looking tired and  like I'm kind of used to feeling tired I just do what I need to do and sometimes if I'm able to if I'm at home and don't have huge commitments yeah I might just like I said earlier just take a nap or something read my book watch TV whatever  lately have I been feeling  kind of down  on myself down on life  well I have this pending need for separation / divorce  I'm worried that I made a lot of mistakes with my girls now they're teenagers you know on the verge of adulthood  and so I worried that you know I did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance in their early childhood and now it's too late  like I missed out on a lot of things  and yeah I need a job I'm unemployed I don't know what I want to do with my life I know I want to do something and I just wish you know I never did finish college unfortunately because I was traveling and stuff  so I regret that extremely  and I need to get a job and be able to take care of myself cuz I need to  divorce and move on with my life so now I forget what the original question was but that's the state part of the state of Mo  no  yes  well  the first time or or or recently  the first time I guess was you know when I was in my early twenties I was just a little upset about constantly that was another breakup I had to make back then I was  in my early twenties and I needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting cuz I  you know it's hard because he didn't want to break up and I feel like I was hurting him and I didn't understand this feeling I was really upset  how did that was my first time having depression so I didn't really recognize it as depression but I went somehow I had the  knowledge or the I was able to take myself to a psychiatrist I remember I paid for her by the hour and she prescribed Xanax to just help relax me  and so I guess that helped me get through that and then I've had depression throughout the years just so you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as I guess it's usually a relationship you know  yeah so the most recent time I was diagnosed and put on meds that was probably about 2 years ago  no  money and I don't have insurance otherwise yeah I'd be happy to go to therapy anything that might help  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  last time I felt really happy  I don't know I guess maybe  when my children were born  I guess happy I just you know I always wanted children so it's nice  to have them  that's I don't know that's all I can remember of that and I guess I don't remember the good times too well I remember the bad times  something you did recently that you really enjoy  something I did that I really enjoyed  well  that's the way I am  Friday night I went to a friend's house and met up with five other girlfriends and we  we created vision boards and talked and had dinner at one of their house that was that was fun  we get to  stay in college get my degree  get therapy trying to become happy  yeah try to figure out things earlier in life  like  yeah  stay in college and and mainly I think the mean and what it all boils down to no matter what your depressed about it seems like  as soon as the saying goes in the  songs go you know it's all about money the world revolves around money in  having none that in itself is for depressing so besides relationships and different things that have happened in your life having no money as you know it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it so with that in mind I would definitely advise myself to get my college degree and to get a job and stick with it don't quit to go traveling and I'll just stick with a job sick with a company build up your seniority keep your benefits  and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of filled yeah that would have been my biggest piece of advice to myself  not much  I guess  just my daughter's you know there are two beautiful daughters and  I'm proud and glad that I was able to have children some people  aren't even able to do that you know and they try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so that's the one thing I mean I wanted five children and I always wanted a boy which I never had but I guess that's the biggest thing I can think of to be proud of  having my two daughters  I'm a very loyal  friend and person that's why when that friend betrayed me I was so devastating  yeah very loyal very  happy was I going to say I was going to say happy go lucky I don't know where that came from very I meant to say friendly and caring and  yeah I care about people  and I'm interested in people  and I care about animals as well actually that's another thing I'm proud of proud of being a vegetarian  yeah so my daughters and being vegetarian and I'm a vegetarian because I really care about feelings of other beings not only humans but animals to in  you know I don't think that animals should be tortured and live a torturous life just so we can eat them  so what was the question  remember the question  okay  you're welcome by  I did need the tissue one time so that's good  the other sister
421,female,1,10,doorbell back over here  alright great thank you  and please  are you okay with  yes that's fine  I'm okay how are you  originally I'm from San Francisco  originally I moved here in gosh 1995 then I went to Chicago then to San Francisco and then back to Los Angeles probably about 5 years ago  a lot of moving  never  there just isn't anything there for me anymore  the weather is better in LA but the people in San Francisco are nicer  my husband prefer my ex-husband prefers at here that's why we moved  okay  I have an undergraduate degree in Psychology and after that I went to law school  when I was in college I worked at a law firm and decided that I really wanted to be a lawyer it was really interesting  are you still working in that no now I'm a stay-at-home mom  you find it easy to be a parent know I loved it but it is it is difficult you have to manage a life to make sure that they become a good and successful person  it's easy to kind of do the academics and stuff like that you know I'm good at that the hardest thing I think is to guide them emotionally to help him through things that he's having a hard time with feeling like I don't have all the answers  I'm just seeing them grow and and experience new things and learn about life in the world it's just it's really really cool  what are some ways that your  completely different completely different and I am not a perfect parent but I love my son I take care of him he's the first priority in my life and they weren't like that at all  well my parents are dead I didn't speak to my dad at all before he died I have a sister and a brother that actually I don't know where they are I don't speak to them either  do you consider yourself more shy  probably more shy because I consider myself more reserved  I like to listen to music  like what I have I listen to all sorts of music but my favorite when I'm relaxing is that 80s music cheesy cheesy but true  it depends on who I'm with if I'm with my son I can control my temper if I'm with my ex-husband or other adults yeah I don't  so so  yesterday and it was about my ex-husband dating the woman that he was cheating on when we were married  can you tell me about that  I found out he was cheating on me and I kicked him out and he told me yesterday that he's continuing to date her  yeah  really angry  and just really hurt  I wish that I had talked to my dad before he died I wish that I had settled our differences before he had died  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to  the hardest decision I've ever had to make was actually ending my marriage  because he was cheating on me  that would have to be  well I don't know I mean I don't know if I'd want to erase anything from my memory because it makes me who I am today  but I can't really think of one event that I would want to erase  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep I don't get a good night sleep it's not easy I wake up a lot in the night  I don't know I wish I knew if I knew I could change it I could try to do something about it but I I just don't I don't know  what are you like when you don't  grumpy irritable  grumpy irritable down  mixed with anger  can you tell me about  it's just because of everything that I'm going through with my soon-to-be ex-husband  yeah there's  I just keep it inside  Meador Staffing else to really do except I mean it is what it is so  I have to  deal with it  no  yes  10 years ago after my son was born  9 years ago I felt like I couldn't cope with life  I was so down I couldn't I felt like I couldn't do anything  I need  no  I don't go to therapy I go to medication management but I don't do talk therapy  I have gone to a therapist and no they don't help  can you tell me if  well some just sit and stare at you and don't say anything you know if I wanted to talk to myself I would others give advice that I think is just  it just not not good and not on point  tell me about the last time you felt  it was probably this morning I was playing with my son  just really happy I wasn't thinking about  any of the other crap  in my life I could just forget it so I was feeling really really happy  I think they would describe me completely different from the way I would describe me but I think they would describe me as really sweet they have really sweet confident  outgoing because that's what I try to be two people so I think that's how they would describe me  I wish I wasn't sad I wish I was more confident  yeah there are a lot of things I think  it would be  to not  not give my life over to one particular person which is what I did with my husband  find your ideal weekend  I think I would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like Palm Springs with my son hanging around the pool having fun going out to dinner  one of my two of my friends to really good girlfriend so I think have been really positive influences in my life  can you tell me if  sure life is worse than mine and the but we can always commiserate together  is just really positive me she's always happy always up always look into the bright side so that has helped me a lot  my son  I went over to a friend's house and we had movie night we watch the grown up movie and had dinner and wine and the boys were in another room watching movies and playing video games and it was just a relaxed fun evening  thanks

335,female,0,12,yes i'm okay  uh i'm from here originally los angeles  mhm um i like the weather  and my family's here which is why i'm here i moved away for a while uh i like that there's a lot of culture <cult> even though everyone says there's not culture in l_a there is a lot of culture there's theater and film and lots of museums and things like that all different kinds of people i like the diversity    mhm um  well i don't like that i had to move back kind of against my will <laughter> so starting a new career uh starting over in my career it so that's not really something uh well i moved back 'cause my dad was sick  so thank you  thank you so that's why i'm here but it also means i live with my dad and my brother who are like hoarders and ridiculous so  uh acting theater it was mhm yeah  yeah i am   i'm an actor i uh right now i'm doing a a theater show and auditioning and taking some classes and  that sort of thing  um well my parents are both artsy people and i grew up around it and for a long time i was singing and then uh i was went to study musical theater and somewhere along the lines i realized that acting was more my bag than singing i suppose but i still do both  mhm no i don't  uh i don't usually have trouble talking to people uh i'm pretty friendly i can get along with most people people usually tell me their secrets within five minutes of meeting me which i feel is a mark of an extrovert <laughter>    <laughter> um  i take a bath or read a book uh go out with my friends go to the theater uh eh sometimes my work is very relaxing so sometimes just like singing a song or any of that going for a walk  mhm yoga things that make me mad um  injustice <laughter> i can be very righteously indignant i suppose um  people who don't see those things and people who've who have a like entitlement i think entitlement and sense of privilege that can make me mad  yeah  uh  it depends i usually <usual> a lot of times it's i argue my case <laughter> i guess <laughter> um or i i call my best friend usually and complain talk to her about it  pretty good pretty good i don't have too much of a temper  um like a real argument or like a debate  <laughter> um if was a real argument it probably would be my ex-boyfriend and we just argued about why we broke up stupid things like that  eh i think i was kind of over it by then but  it was at times  <laughter>  um  the last time i felt really happy  was like really happy probably hanging out hanging out with friends the other night i had a good time uh scrubbed_entry it is it's nice it's nice my best friend would describe me as an open book she often makes fun of me for like just telling everyone everything um she would describe me as   uh compassionate and uh having a a strong sense of who i am  i think yeah she also she would describe me as not having like a good sense of social norms sometimes probably that's something that she  makes fun of me for um because i do just like tell everyone everything and don't realize that i have like holes in my clothes and things like that but nothing nothing bad we have a very good relationship hmm yeah yeah it has <laughter> not terrible trouble but but yeah it's gotten me in trouble before sure  no i haven't  no but i think i had it  but i never went to a doctor  um 'cause i had a i had a traumatic situation uh where somebody injured me and i i feel <fe> when i looked up p_t_s_d later i realized <reali> i felt like i had all of the symptoms of like going back into situations like that i would get panicky and um it was very     uh i held on to it for a really really long time i think um i think that i did have it but i just i don't know 'cause i never i never saw anyone about it   um  sometimes yeah uh certain physical things with that part of my body can be a trigger or um it happened in a in an acting class so sometimes certain teachers if they criticize in a certain way i start to i start to panic even if they're totally right and i know they're right and like it's something that someone else could tell me and i'd be fine with it eh sometimes it'll make me a little upset or panicky yeah  no well i mean my dad is sick so not great  but um but considering not terrible  um i've been having bad dreams  uh  uh just like stress dreams i think having to do with my dad   um  like getting kidnapped or my teeth falling out things that if you looked them up always say like there's something out of your control which is like exactly what it is so      it's not the best but it's just dreams at least so   which way  okay  easy very easy  i am tired and maybe somewhat irritable goofy i get really goofy yeah  um i am fairly non-judgmental  of other people i i i stay open-minded uh i can make most people laugh i'm funny uh creative  um i yeah those are some of the best ones i'd say   yeah  i love meeting new people and seeing new things and learning uh and just getting out of the routine i like staying in hotels uh i like most things about traveling i even i even like flying i like all of it well i just finished a tour a couple months ago um going up and down the east coast and then across the u_s and uh performing for kids all over   yeah and then we ended here in l_a  yeah yeah it was great it was a good time  yeah um  lemmi think we  we went to  the hot springs the naturally occuring hot springs in colorado and that was really nice that was a nice way to unwind yeah  a lot of people i i would say um i mean my dad comes to mind certainly uh my godmother is a huge positive influence in my life as well   uh my best friend my best friend from high school i think i uh some <so> a few of my best friends from high school um and college that i've kinda grown up with and become who i am with them yeah  mhm uh small things sure  yeah uh i regret  the way that i dealt with a friendship that was ending once uh i regret  committing to certain people that i've dated  uh  but nothing huge i i tend to go well i won't do that again but i don't spend a lot of time like being upset about things i've done in the past  hmm stand up for yourself  um  <laughter> don't date felons <laughter> uh i think that i i don't have any trouble standing up for things that i believe in but sometimes i have trouble standing up for myself i think i i really internalize the idea of like you know women being too needy or uh or um i don't know those kinds of things and then xxx and so as as an adolescent and growing up i felt like well you then you just shouldn't need anything or you're needy and it took me a while to be able to like voice what i want what i needed from other people and be okay with that and it's still something i work on  <laughter> i'm glad you think so  um  <sigh> that's a good question uh  my friends and family  and uh  i my talents i would say  yeah  yeah my ability to take situations and  take bad situations and continue and uh make the best of everything  alright  <laughter> thank you  goodbye goodbye

hand you the  okay  and please  are you okay with this  yes  how are you doing  I'm okay I'm a little  pensive I guess a little down but more or less okay  I was born in Annapolis Maryland on the East Coast  originally I moved because I went to film school and but then I decided to come move back to Washington DC to do some work and now I'm back here again  it's very different being from the East Coast it just has a different feel to it but living  La is very as a very different kind of attitude I guess and so it's a little difficult but I but I've gotten more used to it since I've been here  not at all when I left things got things are sort of I lost my job out there and so I had to move out here kind of quick to to be with  some people who are going to help me out and I'm just I don't know if it's strange just the right word but I'm kind of not really speaking to my family are old friends that off  it's not easy it's  it's kind of  I miss I miss a lot of people I miss my old life before I lost my job I miss some friends I miss a lot of the relationships that I had out there so it's difficult I mean it weighs on my mind a lot I feel like I failed and now I'm here and I can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard  you consider yourself more shy or outgoing  depends on the situation I think I'm out going when I'm comfortable and then I'm extremely outgoing but when I'm in a situation I'm not comfortable with this I tend to be a lot more shy so that doesn't really answer your question but  I have certain  I do I do a lot of writing I have certain music that I listen to as I'm writing and when I can when I can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world the music and the the thoughts just kind of happening really it can it soothed me it's like it's when I feel most relaxed I guess  when is the last time that happened  a few weeks ago I guess I was I've been working on a on a on a book on a novel and when I was really what I was really getting into writing it and  it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good I felt like I was accomplishing something and I was felt really relaxed  what was it about  it was about  guy who's searching for something it's  it's it's his last day on Earth and so he's going to find a person that he that he met and just  I was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes he has on Earth with her just because  certified it's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing  what made you decide to do that  well I've always I've always been a writer part of the reason I came to La was because of screenwriting so I wrote some screenplays and you know had a little bit of success with that out here and but since since that I kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and I've started to write more short stories and and longer just creative writing so I've been meaning to write a novel by just waiting for the idea that to really hit me  how hard is that  it's not easy the the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle I find it difficult I have a real love hate relationship with writing when I when I love it I just absolutely love it but sometimes I hate it because it's so difficult but it's worth it for the times when it when it's good  how are you at controlling your temper  good I don't I don't really have a temper it's not I mean most of my anger that I have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people if something is really really stressful if I'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation I can lose it but I've put probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life I mean generally I pretty much try to it when I'm upset I get upset with myself not with other people  when was the last time you argue with someone  last night I guess I got in an argument about whether or not  cleaning vegetables was necessary because of I forget but it well know it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because I'd already started cutting the vegetables and I thought that would be okay so it turned into this big argument and we did Google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and I I ended up being wrong on that one but it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow-up argument but it was a definite argument  okay  what's something you feel guilty about  lot so much  I was in a relationship that I really really better really wanted to work and  I ended up and it was partly due to I hadn't I was on that I wasn't on the right medication and so I was going like everything that sort of spiraled out of control and I feel really guilty about the way that that ended I mean I wasn't I wasn't mean but I was but I was getting more and more messed up and I couldn't stop it and it ended and so I feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not  and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again so  that was pretty that was pretty tough  you've done anything to avoid it  what some of it was was that  I wasn't medicated properly I mean now I've been to a doctor and I'm on medication that's  completely kind of I mean I still get I still get upset and I still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not I don't completely lose it for days at a time so I mean I know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if I had if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then I would have then it would have probably been different if I was who I am now then I would have I would I would be  I would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but I mean I could have  I don't know I don't know if I could have done anything different  things being how they were  I mean it's  it's possible I mean obviously  yeah because I mean that's what I do I I  take little I mean I take little things and I just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy I dwell on stuff and it's like any little detail that comes up I suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day I mean I still I still get I still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed and I feel ashamed about stuff that I did in high school which was years and years ago I which I shouldn't even be thinking about anymore cuz it's so in the past but I still get that feeling like I'm right back there  that sounds really hard  well it's not easy I've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it I mean I dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to slow my mind down that way but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better  well like I said I do a lot of you know if I'm if I'm writing or if I'm doing anything like I kind of have to almost  you doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely if I'm watching TV I have to be playing a game on my phone if I'm using the computer I have to be you know watching a TV show or a movie on you know on it in another window so that I can just keep my mind occupied during all that  I just need I mean I I wish that I could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but I just I can't yet  I need triggered by something  they're triggered by everything pretty much anything that I said I see if I if I if I hear somebody with a Dutch last name if I if I hear somebody talk about Wisconsin if I hear you know she will talk about  anyting you know I can reach back and connect to  to this it's really it's really  I don't know that's the thing I mean I don't ever get a break  from it  now  how easy is it for  I'm a very light sleeper so I'm awake and asleep and awake and is I have no problem going back to sleep but I generally you know don't  I don't know I'd never really needed much sleep so it's just only recently that I've really started to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep like I would I would usually stay up until 2 or 3 in the morning so that I could just be so exhausted that I would just calling out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work but now it's it's it's like if I do that I can't I still don't get enough sleep I don't clock out I still just sleep very lightly you know I get up I toss and turn all night you know and now  it's just it's  yeah I don't sleep too great right now  pretty I mean I don't know it's hard to it's hard to know I usually just kind of power through it and just I'm at I'm like how I am now I just I just feel bad  okay  how long ago were you diagnosed  I think  334 years ago  it was when I  I had been given taking stuff for anxiety for 4  years before that but then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you actually got this situation and we need to get you the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so  so yeah that was that was kind of a turning point but unfortunately it happened after everything went bad so  at the moment I don't know I don't really think I thought about it too much then but looking back on it I feel  it really makes me angry it really makes me you know given where I am right now it makes me really angry that I'm  that I had that I I lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain because of things that I couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me I mean I was paying I was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing it you know it wasn't  it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know I managed to find somebody who did work and I just yeah so I'm I'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now  there really wasn't any choice I had to I was I was a mess I was it was either  I was I was self-medicating it was affecting my work I mean it was everything was just there was a point where I really realized that I mean I just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and and all this stuff you know they just decided that I was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off  but it was at least that and not  firing me but but but yeah but so I got help but it was  but it wasn't soon enough  not not as much as I should  I go to a couple of meetings I go to I go to AA so that I can you know keep control of that aspect to 2 and there's a there's a therapy aspect that unfortunately you know being unemployed my unemployment ran out you know I'm time you know what I'm getting my medication from the city of La so you know I'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody so I have a psychiatrist that I go see but it's really  very I've only seen her three times in the past year so basically to keep my medication coming  then there's you  right  changes have you noticed  well like I said I mean  this the top I mean let's just take the AAA for example because that's probably the close closest for that I'm seeing with therapy right now just saying stuff out loud is just like getting getting the stuff out trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense  that you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a a therapist or just a room full of of drugs you know I mean you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something that you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing  you know better than I that I have been I mean  it is sort of a good it has its ups and downs you know I'm applying for jobs 5-6 jobs or more a day you know I never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to 2 to being self-sufficient again it's hard but that's like real world problems I feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control so now it's just I have to deal with real life witches  Jazz at the juices don't own challenge  it was probably you know a couple of years ago  I was I mean the thing that immediately comes to mind is everything was going well at my job I was making these great videos with this person that I ate that I was having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a Christmas tree  and we spent it all this time picking out the perfect Christmas tree and it was just  feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger  the bigger life  that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel  you know for that instant I felt like  a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and  I mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant I felt like a normal person a normal happy person and  part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that  I don't know if I'll ever feel that again  so  what are you most proud of in your life  probably the  probably this educate educational series I did educational video series I did for the National Science Foundation  it was it was really hard and it would but in the end it turned out really good and you know I'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about  in about the world around them so that I feel like that was a real contribution that I made to the world  I was part of you know it's part of my my job it was it was a we were trying to come up with with new ideas for because we were put together videos and stuff to give you know to two schools and everything and they had done this before but we decided to do something really big you know when there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of  and there was a lot to it and so it was probably the biggest  project that the NSF has decided to do and so we just kind of produced it  I guess  I don't know I don't know it's been awhile it's been awhile since I've since I've really thought about that I don't know what I'd go somewhere would I  I don't know  thank you  Audi

just doing art i draw too my my dream job is not working a job and being me that's the dream job getting paid for being me so that's yeah i'm pretty good like two weeks ago i was at this after hours one i was already like super drunk and two it was after hours three it was after hours so like man i had a bunch of pens these dudes took my pens away <clears throat> pens in my like fanny pack i had

put my arm over him and threw him to the ground and then it got broken up but that was the last time i got angry it was cool it was fun life you know huh i made <gibberish> maybe that maybe that situation could've been handled differently it could've been handled differently if they would've been handling things differently then i wouldn't have to react it's not like i was mad i was acting off of reaction i had to react like that because like justice like i couldn't it was unjust it was like i'm not a mean person at all but when i saw one of my loved ones get attacked i had to like come and like you know like react to that and they were the hot you know what i mean i was like yo ya niggas is tripping like yo chill out this is a tiny little white dude you're a humongous ass mexican nigga it's like you need to fall back you know what i mean it was crazy <laughter> guilty uh i don't know i steal shit sometime from stores when i'm hungry if i got no money i guess i'm not really

maybe like little like idle here and there exaggerations okay <ok> nah nah never the hardest i guess i don't really know what the hardest decision was but i get faced with hard decisions and those would be like i got so many friends sometimes i can't really hang out with everybody in one weekend so it's like i gotta make decisions like if i go over this sector of the town i'm gonna hang out with x y z niggas if i go over here x y z niggas so it's like heavy you know those are hard decisions 'cause i never like to let anybody down so uh yeah stuff like that deciding between friends to

sweet little blind old lady who cooks really good and it's tight i don't know something i could erase from my memory i wouldn't wanna erase anything from my memory 'cause that'll be like because like the experiences you go through make you who you're who you are i think weak people like to wanna erase things or block things out like i don't that doesn't exist i mean there's shit that's been hard but i would never say i would not want that to happen 'cause you know you must you gotta learn from experience you know i mean to be the better you all that shit is like a is like test you know that bad experience is just a test you gotta overcome and be stronger and not just like curl up and be like oh my god life's hard oh you know that shit's for weak people i don't believe in that i have compassion for people who do get a who do wanna do stuff like that but i still like i don't see the logic in it mm i mean i stay up pretty late and do all sorts of reckless ass shit so uh but when i am home and it's pretty easy i could just go to sleep you know when i get tired i get tired yeah lately i've been on this like i've been partying hella tough lately like oh my god for at least six

i'm like i'm chilling i definitely gained a couple pounds from last week i've been drinking a lot of beers i'm feeling a little extraneous but besides that i'm i'm ready hmm okay i don't know as a lovable dude people be loving me man they don't like me they love me and that shit's crazy i just you know i just try to be happy i try to make people happy and just you know <sniffle> be real posi-core as they've said like this is hella positive <p> positive you know man i really don't wish i could i mean i'd lose weight i guess that's about it but besides that i that's i mean i ride bikes every day like my legs are pretty strong maybe i'd just get more buff in the arm but that's about the only thing i would change and i don't really <r> i'm not really in a hurry to change that like if that happens just through me living and me biking more then yeah cool but i don't not <n> i'm not you know abrupt change i don't need i mean gradual change sure but i'm not i don't know yeah i wouldn't change anything but if i would it would be that but really nothing 'cause i'm chilling right now uh i don't know i got broken up with like in august that made me feel bad about myself i guess and yeah it was just somebody i was going out with but they just broke up with me and like that shit sucked but that was probably the last time like i felt really bad about myself <cough> um what exactly do you wanna know about that oh like um i don't know we were just going out and then she was just hella jealous and was going through my phone sometimes and accusing me of shit but then she ended up breaking up with me just 'cause she wanted to like mess around with other people and that was the relationship in a nutshell uh life sucks you gotta adapt and change man know what i mean don't walk from it run to what'd you say yeah that bitch gave me s_t_ds that shit sucks fucking a that's the only thing i regret yeah man it's a cold game but i i got the shot it was cool i'm like boom clean but that's about it i don't know she's a cool person we still hang out you know she keep losing i'm just gonna keep winning know what i mean don't run from it run to it know what i mean <laughter> wait wait ten <t> ten or twenty years ago i i was only seven years old you what do i tell my seven year old self he wouldn't be able to comprehend the advice i would give what <w> what'd you say oh oh oh yeah he wouldn't um be able to comprehend the advice i'd give him i'd be like just um fucking read a little more books or something dude like uh i don't know man fucking it's gonna be okay you're you you you're great just keep doing <ts> cool shit and have a ball i don't know i wouldn't know i wouldn't wanna alter young me actually and this is why i say this because if i would to tell my young self to do something differently i would not have grown into the person i am right now to even be able to tell my young self something if if <i> if the laws of quantum physics and all that shit is real and time travel you know anything i do in the past would this life would be now be a variable so me going back there telling him to do something differently will alter the course of history and then the time stream that i'm in may not may cease to exist you know what i'm saying so i really wouldn't wanna do that i'll just be like do fuck up fuck up more even but yeah make more mistakes 'cause the only way to to be a better person is to make hella mistakes you know at least that at least that's like my my reckless like mindstate like yo if you're gonna fuck up fuck up hard 'cause you'll learn more from it you know they say what do they say um experience is the best professor you know what i'm saying that's basically what that that's how i jive you know what i mean <sniffle> i'm proud of this life that i'm here doing stuff like this <laughter> like i'm like so stoked i've been around the country i've been on people's albums i write i do voiceover works from time to time and yeah i people know me i rap i ride bikes i've infiltrated multiple subculturals i mean subcultures and types of people in the city scrubbed_entry and um yeah man i don't know i guess it's

we're a pretty close knit family talk every day um see each other almost every day  there've been a lot of positive um influences in my life i would say my aunt and uh definitely my mother have all been positive influences  well um i look i look <l> i uh <clears throat> look up to my aunt um i think she's positive i look up to her  because obviously we grew up with very similar backgrounds came from very similar neighborhoods and areas and she's very successful um despite the types of things that we've gone through as children  and um she doesn't let her past define her future uh my mom's overcome so many obstacles as well um she had some challenges with her health but she still tries to be optimistic and she's still tries to   you know overcome these things and just still live our life despite some physical barriers that she might have so i look up to people who are able to  you know not allow their current situation to dictate their future because anything is possible   no i have not  no i have  um well i was diagnosed um within the last um year and uh then again most recently within the last three months  well um fear and just not knowing what to do with uh some of the things i was feeling and not knowing um you know why i couldn't stop feeling the way i was feeling  there were a lot of symptoms um  um you know mostly i uh i gained a lot of weight um i couldn't sleep a lot and then sometimes i could sleep too much <laughter> um  felt sad sometimes  like i wanted to cry a lot  i've been feeling okay um there are days yeah um i don't know every day is different so i mean today i feel fine but like i said everything is differently lately i've been feeling um more like i can be involved <inv> involved in my own life and like i wanna get   out and do more things  um  no no it's no no i haven't  not any different from before what i was experiencing before  no  mm well mm i was receiving um  uh i guess psychotherapy and um i don't know a lot of things happened i moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother and i just kinda  got more involved in taking care of other people instead of myself for a while  uh sometimes  i do  yes it is it's kinda difficult um i either have a hard time falling asleep or a hard time staying asleep i'm sure it is i just don't know what it is as of yet because i you know <sniffle> usually it's um thoughts continual thoughts running through my mind that either keep me up or make it hard for me to uh go asleep or make it hard for me to stay asleep mhm um journal sometimes uh that might help if i can write some things down and get it out that helps other than that i don't you know i haven't found any really great ways of coping  it tired <laughter>  yeah mostly uh tired um kinda confused  i don't know for the most part i feel happy it's just um   last time i felt really happy was i guess over the holidays  uh i don't know i guess the just being around uh family and friends just the holiday season i guess in general that's just a happy time for me and seeing people i haven't seen in a while um that's about it  how would my best friend describe me probably as um  quiet sometimes cautious talkative sometimes um tenacious  um i don't know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for uh some of my accomplishments and they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because i'm caring and compassionate or um easy to talk to um that i remind them of a of <o> feel like a sister to them  <laughter>  um everyone has regrets i'm sure yeah i regret stuff  to just  relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and i don't mean to sound that way but it's true it's just um you have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you um to not compare yourself to other people because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their  their time and their progression to how they get to things so i would tell me ten years ago to just believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that i want for my life and don't be  yeah  um really enjoyed working with um well  okay a science project <laughter> with um my younger uh relatives my cousins we did a science project together and it was fun despite the mess we made it was a ball um being the first to attend college in my family and then um going to college and coming back to the community where i uh went to school and then teaching in that community and volunteering in that community and helping um youth or children that come from the same background that i came from so  uh i'm most proud of being able to  have the opportunity to improve and better myself and then to come back and help someone else improve and better themself as well   goodbye

453,male,1,17,hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today yes  Los Angeles  convenience convenience  people the crowd  traffic  people that lack of respect  locally originally  meeting old people I love talking old people  I work a lot with my elders in my reservation and other reservations here in California and I spend a lot of time with her with the elders I talked with them and they helped me out of  Target are good stories  going in the mountains and seeing waterfalls then no one else is saying except for my people and I was the most beautiful thing I think I found  it depends on the situation if I'm if somebody comes to me looking for me to help them I take control it if I need help with its I work at asking for help so it depends on the situation  I Garden  and I think  very good.  3 days ago it was about communication and the lack of communication on the other person's part and I needed them to communicate better so that way I could understand and they didn't communicate so we had an argument and I got to settle  I felt I'm caught off guard because this is an individual that I spend pretty much almost every minute of my day with and to not be told what was going on in this person's head and then to have a situation arise and I was kept out I didn't like that  I got a pass  probably lack of time spent with my grandparents  just wanted on you regret that you didn't miss time with spend time with me  I want thing I truly wish I could remember I was I was a professional athlete and what time I have party till like 4 in the morning and then I had did my event at like 10 in the morning and I was my captain and I'm very smile team  that's one thing I truly believe that  are the professional fighter soon  yeah I'm not party. About other people besides myself  I studied massage therapy and Nursing degree  a lot of it's just been on job education  I'm very  I'll get to my own injuries I just going through the therapy process and believing in people and seeing how it worked and I decided to do that I wanted to help people too  are you happy  oh yeah  yes  I want to paint that's all I want to do is just paint  I have two sons and it's time for me to the move on and they're older and they can take care of themselves now so many leaving the area where my sons are sweetheart  the reflection of you  play reflection of you a mind you so much about yourself Who You Are  consistency even when you're sick  I don't assume my kids are right around by listen to him first and then make my decisions after that and I try not to come from an emotional hiding place but I think logically and I put myself in their place before I do it we discuss we communicate happy in my family cuz that's the only way we get along with each other through communication  communicate  my family is severed pretty much so my family my relationship with my family on the reservation is very tight and the rest of the family were all fragmented scattered around the Southwest so it's not very tight at all  I have too many to count  start with my uncle my uncle was like my dad. Me to go away  he watched out for me he told me he taught me hard work at a very young age he also taught me to protect my family  Tommy honor. Me Love  it's a good man  how easy is it for you to get a good night  I don't lie ever had a good night sleep in years so I have to get broken sleep  are dreams the dreams you come through real  get up and go to the bathroom and go back to sleep  my years of fighting and just got up to me  reserved  reserved and I try to find things to distract my brain to think of different ways of doing things  I got rid of TV about 8 months ago so I got rid of that distraction so what I do now is ready to paint a garden or cleaning house washing dishes or get out the walk that's nothing to do a lot of walking out is  anxiety anxious  my anxieties  habits good I have techniques to bring myself down  nothing new  out of the normal  yes  3 years ago around 3  insomnia issues  it was about  2 years ago around there to look it over two years ago I was released from therapy  off the therapist Release Me  what I noticed is I still deal with pictures and emotions  what would I do is now if I really practice hard at taking care of myself and then getting to those places to things that  strike me give me anxious or excited or angry I learn how to work out of it and realize it's not real it's not real  that's just the emotion it's not real so these are the things like no manches and I tell myself and this is really helped me a lot from therapy because it taught me that those emotions and pictures truly aren't real  and that's the therapies helped a lot that mean it's just a change my world  if  around the same time as the PTSD  after years ago  in my dreams when I dream I do  last night  I just dreaming of fighting and then in preparing fighters to fight I wasn't nothing to I build up anxiety dreaming about preparing fighters to fight and then stepping in front of thousands of people and then I always end up fighting in my dreams so it's always what gets me scared in all my dreams is that I should have made the move and finish the fight and I didn't  and so builds anxiety and stressing me that I tend to act out in my sleep  I was real like I was there right like I smell taste feel everything their house there  on this morning driving here talking to my girlfriend  trustworthy  he loves me I love him he's more best friends  a 02 change  I can recall  okay  I got it  just not spending time with my grandparents and in  I think they today issues maybe you know a couple here there that I should have went to the store first or something like that but I mean it's nothing like that  quit thinking you know it all  my loyalty  my trustworthiness  the new art project yesterday  nice  where is Santa Barbara from the film some rocks and some old rock song Someone that made by loving just threw a dump old rocks out of the way and it went through the pile of rocks and I found the soul rock that was in the middle of it and then took a home and now I'm doing art piece on it and for me it was like the thing was totally forgotten about was just considered a rock and now they're sure you'll be sitting in my grand kids table and let's just give me a call like that  what are you most proud of in your life  start starting something that I'm so bad at  then I don't think there's no way I can be good at it and all sudden I get to be better at it so I don't even have to think about it just so good at it that way I could just touch it and feel it and then I think about it these are the things I'm proud of like I like that I like that  accomplishment I guess you can say  her her left clavicle needs adjustment  her clavicle set tired makes it look like she's been in a car accident and she's like this sheet her left shoulder is up higher and it's question so you're off and it's drawing my attention to that so I don't know if you guys noticed that to the other part of it too is the hand motions that she does some of the hand motions are very aggressive in it and wakes it was very distracting in the beginning because she was like  fast moving like my therapist cuz we working with the PTSD issues he that he did everything slowly cuz I said off on quick trigger movements and so like with her hand movements like that. Like this talkin it was distracting in the beginning but besides that everything is just like it's pretty amazing computer but it's and you feel comfortable that is a good thing  yeah yeah

466,female,0,9,I was that man  when do I talk okay okay  okay  yeah that okay okay it's better okay thanks  okay thank you thank you  yes  okay  Los Angeles  the weather  the variety of environments the ocean you know various different environment or environmental variety  I don't like the superficiality of people the narcissistic attitude  just the  it doesn't have a small-town sort of feel where you know just the warm the human sort of warms the interactively so yeah  no  am I have a fear of flying and I have developed agoraphobia  incredibly difficult  I'm guessing you mean the agoraphobia more so than the fear of flying it's it's more of a recent development and  it's it's pregret it's progressing to be worse it's very what's the word immobilizing and very distressing actually  yes it is  how do I cope with that  just  just trying to do the best I can and try to you know have the most courage I can in the situation and challenge myself and small steps I read a lot I do I'm bibliotherapy reading and I try to inform myself of the of the professional literature I'm so that I could hopefully over comment someday  yes definitely  certain things trigger at like enclosed spaces being in a car traveling being away from home being in someone else's car things that are outside of my locus of control  add actually I don't go to school right now  my dream job is  to be a psychologist  I'm not a psychologist but what would make me decide to do that is  having lived through some challenges like this having lived through some traumas but I've always had an interest in it since junior high of I'm very interested in people and Men human interaction and human connection and the betterment of of of those things bridging people together and helping people interpersonally through their child personal challenges so that's that's sort of in a nutshell  I think I'm someone who's  I can be very outgoing and sort of a warm and friendly presents very easily but I think on the exterior but I think I'm shy and I challenged it to do that  I think it hard I'm shy but I but I challenge myself completely cuz I do love human interaction so I take those risks and and jump and those challenges  the last time I interacted with somebody was today  if I think I'm understanding your question correctly  oh no I think I misunderstand your question but I I interacted with Rachel I just I'm continuously interacting with people  take taking those risks  a very good  very good  I just left them argued with somebody  actually can't remember it wasn't recent  I have to think about that I don't know yet let me think  I'm drawing a blank I can only remember things  from what I was like 21 right now I can't think of anything contemporary right right now my mind is  okay I when I was younger  can you tell me about that yes I lost a relationship with my aunt and my uncle and my cousin's cuz when I was 21 on 45 I  I had a disagreement with my aunt and I said something that was a critical of her and she threw me out of their home and  let me back I apologized immediately and they let me back into their lives and change their minds so  I regret that  I'm assuming you mean how do I feel when they asked me to never I'll be in their lives again and to leave shattered Soul shattered heart shattered  tell me about  well that that was my family that was the good side of my family there's  the majority of my fat they were they were the the loving aspect of my family on the rest of my family is very cruel and very abusive  I'm I don't have any relationship with my family at all like there since I was 21 since my aunt and uncle  disown me I guess it's the right word estranged yeah  gosh I'm drawing a blank just bear with me for one second something I could erase  I can't even get it to my memory  as an example  I was injured and I wish I could get that away from my memory  yeah I was injured in the emergency room  doing I went in for food poisoning I was ordered to go in by a doctor I had collapsed and I was ordered to go into the ER for that I said food poisoning and I came out injured with a neurological syndrome I was injured with a  what do you call it  intravenous procedure and now I have RSD reflex sympathetic dystrophy and the scene in the emergency room was it was an out-of-control saying there was a problem with the procedure and the doctor was yelling at his staff who made a mistake and it was extremely excruciating it was a crisis and so every time I think about the injury and it was disfigured I got disabled got disabled for disabled permanently from it was also a disabled from my employment for a quite amount of a given amount of time as well and and it I have residual physical Trauma from it and disfigurement and  severe disability disability limited functionality with my right my I'm right-handed my right hand and arm thank you  tell me about the hardest decisions  I don't even know what that is  you know I I really I apologize cuz I can't really probably give you the most suitable answer  I'm guessing it has something to do with my cat and her her urgent  what do you call it  I heard she was in intensive care veterinary care and I'm sure it had something to do with that  but other than that I would say I had Choosing My Life Path weather  and I was admitted to that program or whether I was going to go to art school for four years and I had to pick a life Direction but that's not a traumatic situation  so I don't know how best to answer your question  I can't  I have severe nightmares and I have nocturnal panic attacks  are you triggered by something and I also have physical illness on top of it and I'm in excruciating pain  you have disturbing thoughts  yes  yes  yes they're triggered by the injury that I told you they're triggered by my family  how they've treated me what they said to me what they've done to me they're triggered by what else my my physical illness not my injury Olney but my physical illness as well so yes  I feel very ill  and feel so fatigued  very ill and very fatigued  when I don't sleep and get enough sleep at my anxiety level I believe is up and I'm susceptible to feeling distressed so yeah  yes  3 years ago my most recent diagnosis and in 2001 as well  oh yes  3 years ago and  when I was  20 years old  the my background my childhood from my family of origin and there are the abuse that I went through and their ultimate what's the word  rejection of me and estrangement that was the first reason  no I stopped 6 months ago  why did I stop I'm just taking a break I'm going to continue  yes very much  it's helped tremendously  I think it helps with anxiety at helps with  it helps Inspire crate inspiration that helps feeling connected it helps to create what I ultimately my goal is to give myself a voice and it helps to to side is part of that process it also helps to understand myself to learn about myself  and there's just so many benefits it's  I'll stop right there and there's many more  the last time I felt really happy is it was a really long time ago it was before my illness and it was in 1997 on the outside of my illness was in July of 97 so it was before that  yes I was in a very good place in terms of my career in terms of my just my relationships and everything was just sort of at its best career relationships personal fulfillment start of as well I was very active and and doing a very many things that were made in full to build a life thumb and I was in the process of  just in the in the planning stages of my life but also very accomplished at the same time so it's just that they were just going very well and I was just really liked just where my life was at it was just in a really good place and many ways  I wish I could change about myself my anxiety I wish I could change about myself my agoraphobia my PTSD meeting my trauma and what else  my insecurities as far as just  with other people in the sense that I'm always trying to make sure that that I don't do something that that hold on one second I'm just trying to make sure that I don't do anything that's offensive to them or insults them or is disrespectful and I I feel like I'm overly cautious about that and it kind of becomes an anxiety unto itself so I I definitely think that would be beneficial to change the other thing I'd like to change about myself and I wish I could feel and also depression I'd like to change about myself I wish I could feel better I wish I didn't feel so tired of the burden that I do love my family I'm not having one  and what else I wish I didn't have my illness and the physical excruciating pain that I'm in so those are some things and I also wish that and this is a byproduct of PTSD I wish that I didn't have the the symptom ology of PTI say is that definitely affects one's complete complete life like her life completely and I wish I was more articulate and I wish I was someone who was well-spoken and someone was well-written but there's many there's many more things that I wish I could change about myself to improve myself so many more  I'm not sure  maybe to not be so trusting I trusted  I trusted some medical professionals that  you know again created the injury and it a word  there's a what's the word there's an expectation and it sort of a demand to just blindly trust the medical profession and don't ask questions or just sort of you know and if not to trust your own self your own your own instincts or intuition and so I would I would have told myself to be a little more careful I guess if that's useful to your question  what did I really enjoy  and I can't think of anything specific  but  I know it would have to do  with either reading or connecting with someone on a meaningful level  I'm most proud of  my compassion  my my empathy and caring about people despite I mean I'm proud of it anyways but I'm also particularly am I

353,female,1,11,yes  i'm okay  um pennsylvania  mhm um well i was in boston for a couple years and then i moved here about three and a half years ago but um i just wasn't satisfied with the quality of my life um maybe once or twice last year i only got to back once a year um definitely safer and um definitely a more um well i just miss it 'cause i have a lot of family back there but l_a is okay i i mean everyone loves the climate here um  not too easy i have two really good friends here and i have a boyfriend i've been with for three years so that helps he's from here but um it definitely took a a bit of adjustment  no um advertising communications  um no i'm currently working in actually i'm not working right now at the moment um i wanna be an osteopathic physician  um so basically versus western medicine an osteopathic physician is someone who helps someone with the symptoms and doesn't just treat the symptoms but treats them as a whole person so they look at nutrition they look at diet exercise um just a variety of things to <t> to actually get someone to live  a healthier life versus medications or things that are commonly prescribed now in the western medicine  um well one of the great things was when i came out here to l_a i was um exposed to the degree which i had never heard of living on the east coast   um sometimes  um well i'm very particular about the people i like to surround myself with um and eh i don't like to socialize with a lot of people i mean i tend to um like small intimate groups and i don't tend to like to be in larger or bigger groups um eh when people don't take into account other people's feelings  um i usually  try to go for a walk if i get <laughter> very irritated  um i'm usually really good it really takes a lot for me to spill over and to yell or become upset   um <sigh> let's see uh mm i was at with my lawyer and it was about his handling of my case  yeah it was he's uh they're i don't know i think they're just a little bit mediocre they're not the best lawyers   i have no idea <laughter>  um i'm very trustworthy i'm loyal um i care very deeply so i i like to try to help other people um and i always like to try to cheer people up so <laughter> i think that's that would be some of 'em  no yes  um just a few months ago about in the last six months  um i was experiencing  mental issues that i'd never really came across before paranoia and anxiety and i knew that it wasn't  um i knew that i it wasn't that i couldn't overcome it by myself  um a lot better i've been doing a lot of yoga and meditation um kinda seeing things from a different per view or another <ano> not per <pe> per view but a different view and um  that's helped but there's definitely times where i kind of sink back into thinking about the event especially because the event caused me to stop working   um  i think i you know i have a difficulty being in public um i'm still dealing with anxiety and paranoia about that and that something may happen so um so a lot of times during the day is when it happened so i'm not that comfortable going out during the day i tend to go out in the mornings and evenings and um i don't like to go into places where there's only one way in and one way out um well i've been gradually trying to increase how much i'm outside um  and i usually just deep breathing um i do a lot of breathing exercises and i just try to say that basically what i'm thinking or what's going on with me is not real um and that   i just i try <laughter> i just try to get myself to go into these places more gradually a lot better since uh the last couple months but before i very much pretty much stayed home    um  it's been good um it's been good to hear someone's feedback but um i feel like i've gotten more help with just my inner talk with just kind of sitting with myself and journaling  i do  um <sigh> well i feel like more like myself which is a huge improvement um and i am more cautious and er guarded in some ways about my thoughts um and about my decisions as well i'm not so i'm not so oh you know i'll just do this and not really think of the consequences of other things that i want in my life   um it's gotten better i'm okay <ok> i'm better now um the first three months it was very difficult i couldn't sleep through the night and i woke maybe two or three times and would be awake for a couple hours but now i am um sleeping through the night again  um i feel <f> groggy <sigh> k i feel foggy and out of it um  and just low kind of depressed  mm <sigh> it's um i think it's been awhile  um working <laughter> i'm a bit of a workaholic um spending time with my family um yeah just being outside enjoying nature reading um very close  what is that  um scrubbed_entry um well my parents 'cause they've always been very supporting and loving um giving me feedback about my decisions or what i'm choosing to do but allowing me to make my own um decisions my own choices in life and then  my sisters have just always been very um you know just always checking with me i'm the baby i'm the youngest in the family so they always um  looking out for me and just checking in with me and then my boyfriend xxx with this um incident that happened um he's been very uh usually supportive with just letting me kind of have my talk and work things out and understanding when i'm feeling and not wanting to go out in public and and being aware of that that it's not so easy for me just to do something like grocery shop or um running errands without having a lot of anxiety  um i'm most proud of  the jobs the work that i've done the people i've helped um  maybe that i took this job where i was assaulted at <laughter> that would be it going into retail into unsafe environment not listening to my gut  um  what advice would i what uh to recklessly pursue your dreams um that there is no such thing as too late or running out of time and and to enjoy every moment of your life not take anything for granted  um  let's see uh <sigh> well cooking i really enjoy <enj> i really enjoy cooking um  so i made some roasted vegetables just any time i'm cooking i just really enjoy it um we have a garden so we had collard greens that came up and um some chilis and cauliflower so just using preparing that for <f> um for my um boyfriend and i  mhm bye thanks 
617,male,1,12,wow  okay  I broke it  not so good  okay  all right questions and then when she's done she should say goodbye and you can press this button  okay  okay  should be how good  yes  I'm doing pretty good  originally I was born in Denver Colorado  I like the beach sunshine  pretty girls  the ocean  other things  smog  excess amount of people in traffic that can be dealt with  I would like to travel more  seeing new things and and learning perhaps if you culture or something  oh okay I when I was younger I went to Europe and just did the backpacking thing  backpack around Europe for a little while and it was it was real fun  I'm probably just being in the military with some friends and stuff like that  why have a degree in film and I'm finishing a degree in or for business as well  now I look for work I'm trying to do some sort of entrepreneurial effort now as I finish my business degree  it'd probably be to own my own company that's kind of why I want some sort of entrepreneurial effort to push push for with some sort of interesting product or service that I'd be working in  I would say middle of the road a little bit shy and at times can be takes a while to warm up  are you cautious to meet someone new and then from there  I kind of see where to go from there I guess  my family they still live in Colorado their interesting people and good as well as I talk to him  pray couple times a week they're good people I have one brother and he has a couple of kids and that he's married as well  that's a good question lately I've been trying to get a daily amount of exercise like jogging or riding a bike and recently got a bike  something like that on a daily  effort  for the most part pretty good I try to if I have an outburst or if I'm being irritable I try to stay away from people who didn't like to go off on people they didn't do anything wrong  Edward change the topic in my mind I guess  what gets me in trouble would be more I avoid things and it kind of builds up and becomes worse  and that kind of gets the trouble and  basically just in a relationship with a girlfriend  to be honest with that it remember exactly what it was about it's just probably in one of us is being irritable and me and  going from there or it's probably a lot to do with the money as well I don't have the best financial security at this point  that's a good question  oh my I guess I I do Harbor a little bit of guilt from the military as far as getting out and people are still in I suppose I know that's it's not for me anymore  only thing well I I used to work at for a friend and I invested into his company  and the economy went down was a construction accessory company basically and kind of movement down and we lost most of our money like most of the folks around America and that pretty much  it was a good and bad thing is you got to look at it from a good good perspective but it definitely put it myself into talespin I financially and couldn't really do anything about it almost was homeless for a little while  but I I wish I wouldn't have invested into the company and just move forward and  perhaps going to school like I'm going anyway  I have  I was 21  I wanted a change in life I wanted some more real-world experiences  answer my country and also the added benefits of going to school or nice I didn't have  much Financial capabilities at that time and I wanted to change to get out of my current situation and that was the best way out I thought  are you happy  yeah yeah I'm very happy I join the military I appreciate it now more that I mount and understanding kind of what I supposed war was about it is definitely changing people and myself as well  yeah I did a tour both in Iraq and Afghanistan as well  see I thought at first it was very easy and then I came to understand he was very difficult  just because I was adjusting from military life and still having that in my head and not until now I realize that I probably just a few months ago  to Reno reintegrate myself a little bit better and choose civilian life which it's it's actually it's actually pretty difficult  no problem  movie think I when I got out of the military  versus I'd I invested like I said into my friend's company and we started that little business we're doing well for the while working and then lost all of our money  and then I traveled for a while at a gender stand now is obviously some other issues but I traveled all over America good working and went to school in New York for a little while  lived in a few different states and came back to California where I'm finishing school finally  living the dream  that's a good question I would say  well it didn't and instills you with with very good I think since of  sense of character and strength and you know I think there's a lot of good qualities that the military are military puts a new people but at the same time it puts a lot of bad qualities  as well because you need some sort of edge or something that you need on on am almost daily basis and if you don't get that then in a lot of guys do you know turn into drinking or drugs just cuz you can't get that same Edge  and that really that can really either hurt or benefit you  I've been feeling okay I've had a bit of a sinus issues lately but I've been feeling okay  actually I have my my thoughts I used to really have scattered thoughts  and  I would say I'm starting to get a little bit better Clarity which is good  taking a lot of different therapy and stuff like that and it it's actually helped  it's it's very as I can't really let the tough part for me is the schedule because that's if I'm not tired you don't sleep you just lay there  it's Hit or Miss really some nights I can sleep pretty well some nights I have to wait till I'm exhausted  and I don't like doing pills  pills are bad I didn't understand that but it's basically just can't sleep because either you're on my mind is always thinking about something or something I feel that I have to do but yet I'm not doing anything that's not true trying to always do something or do you have some some troubling dreams at times but that doesn't really negate me from sleeping and wakes me up is what it does because it can't be that the dream that you remember versus the one that you don't  when I don't sleep well  perhaps your ability and anxiety definitely go up I I definitely get I have a tendency to get a lot of headaches  and not sleeping very well definitely puts that into the mix  I have  not that I know of no  I I don't know I try to feel happiness on a daily basis I guess what you could answer but I'm not certain  I'll say my my dad's been a very positive influence  that's a good question charismatic her funguy pretty tough  a good worker  I'd say I really enjoyed jogging  the other day on the beach  something that I am most proud of I would say I'm actually an online Minister as well and I married my brother and his wife and that was a pretty proud experience  all good  she said goodbye  okay
320,female,0,11,perfect okay  and okay and then I will let you know  no I just said my hair was when my problem happening cut my hair and stuff  okay now tell me again  okay  yes  I know nervous  this is different  California  yes  I like the beach  the weather  some of the people  what do you mean  what I do now  I don't know right now  I went to nursing  yes  no  about nursing  that's a great feeling of being if you have the heart the passion for caring for people  my mother  yeah  right now we're close I'm pretty close family  what do you mean  okay  I like to read  I like watching some television  I think I'm very good at controlling it  I can't remember  laundromat  I'm not for sure what I do when I'm really annoyed I think I get I don't know walk alot I'm not for sure when I'm annoyed have different reactions to when I was annoying me  make me mad  mad is a hell of a word for me to be mad and means like Nomad is so uncontrollable when I'm mad  I don't have a best friend  I don't really know now  my mother  but my mother  mother was a beautiful woman and she had great values and still did not swim in raising me  but I use a lot of Google one thing is my my mother cooked and I was a valuable thing to me cuz she taught me to cook  so that was very valuable honesty  I'm by my mother  which is no longer living  excuse me  changing my behavior  and since I've been here  I don't know I think a little uncomfortable  yeah we'll strains  call Vinson lately  uneasy  because of my experience  the things I went to a been going through  I was raped and sodomized  and they kept a gun to my head and cut my hair so I've been going through a hell of a thing lately  yes it is  how cold this is difficult but I do cold  it's not easy for me to sleep to get a good night sleep  excuse me  I don't know make you sluggish  maybe sometimes I can be more irritable when I don't sleep well when I don't sleep well that often  yes that's what I have been in Iceland  a few years ago  cuz I wanted to get revenge on the guys that rape me  no  but I'm going to go back scuse me  I thought I was better I thought  I knew I had a problem but I didn't know what it was  as far as what  I didn't sleep I didn't eat  I had nightmares  I still have them  real  afraid of afraid  as far as what  disturbing sounds like what  of the things that's happened to me those are disturbing thoughts  sometimes  if I see four men together with hoods on his I have a triggered by that sometimes when I have to go upstairs and it's a trigger because of the of what happened they took me upstairs  yes ma'am  excuse me  therapies what  I'm going to stay out before a while but I've noticed how to calm myself down  when I get on a frayed and  that's not it  helped a lot of things that happened in my past I didn't realize it was deep down inside we still  just just you know just  day by day just making it I think  music  cooking the other day  cooking  my son  only have one son  and he's a beautiful Channel  no it's not  I think this is you making  some of the things that he's asked  like I'm not into tattoos I don't like tattoos and he does  and  why is a lot of different things  that's a given life  and seeing them grow up and joy and their lives is going on that's a good thing  no  last night  I don't really know  I really don't know  as far as what  my memo experience  say when graduating good experience  yes  great graduated great  graduate from high school and I enjoyed School  I don't remember  why  how to sleep  this is Beach  okay
628,female,0,0,like  is this okay  okay  okay thank you  I'm going to bring her up bring a l a pretty name does it stand for  oh okay  oh that's right  of equations when she recognizes what you say Okay coolness  oh I got it  okay  Valley let's go  I don't want no problems  no problem does tracking my facial stuff right now  okay  that is so need okay  party  okay  okay  okay  okay  sound like a plan  okay  okay thank you  thank you  okay  yes  I'm doing fine thank you  California  San Pedro California  find the weather of course I really love the weather also this is where all my family lives so  you know it's good to be around your family  and just a lot to do out here  I wouldn't say a lot like maybe once or twice per year  memorable in a good way I would say having my children at three children so I guess that's the most memorable  right now I'm just doing liberal arts so General Studies nothing specific  I do take a lot of I do take a lot of science classes because eventually I do want to pursue education in Psychology but that's later on  my dream job I really thought about it  I don't know  honestly I really don't know  I wouldn't say shy I'm a little reserved I think there's a little difference  oh no not really shy  to text me a little bit longer to warm up  I don't know I just like to read people before I really open up to them to see how much I'm willing to share  and how much I'm not willing to share  it's okay I mean I love my family we have our ups and downs  specifically I guess with my mother you know is a little bit more up but I'm the only girl so it's expected I have three brothers so with that being said it is what it is it's good when it's good and when it's not good  it could be better  probably watch TV or you know does not got my pick up a book or something magazine see what's going on in fashion just something to keep my mind off things  pretty good I also play games I like to play games on my phone on the computer things like that I wouldn't say I have a temper you know just average you know when things upset me I deal with them but I don't overdo it I don't you know explode or anything like that  probably what's today Friday probably my see was it yesterday no day before yesterday actually was with my mom it's it's so funny the argument with about she feels that because I'm a mother a wife and a mother that I should not have a social life  meaning I should be at home knitting or something I don't know so it was small that wasn't a big argument just you know I mentioned that I may go to a comedy event and she was against it I said well it's really not your decision I'm an adult so that was about it  that's about it  recently  probably  I mean thick I'll probably should have you know  oh I know when my husband and I were discussing relocating from California I basically put my foot down and said I wasn't you know willing to do that and I probably should have kept it up in mind because there are some pros to moving or relocating but I guess at the time I really just didn't want to hear it so I just put my foot down and said you know we're not going anywhere with staying here I probably should have been more understanding because he is from  you know he's not from California so he's probably feeling a little homesick and I should have took that into consideration  guilty probably not spending as much time with my kids it's not because I don't want to spend time with them many not altogether like usually when I spend time with my children it's separate when I always together unfortunately because my middle son has autism so he takes a little bit more time so I wish that you know we could all be together and I do feel guilty about that  but it's difficult  so I try to give them their own individual time  but it  hardest decision probably I don't know  my former occupation my former job relocated for about an hour and a half away something like that little bit over an hour depending upon traffic and was a good paying job great benefits great people but I had to basically  play myself off from that job which did create a financial hardship in my family but I didn't have a choice because of our you know situation with our son and having only one vehicle for transportation if it's a lot of other factors you know I basically had to stop working and that was a big decision but you know I always say happiness over finances you know you can all I can always you know find another job but you know having my family together and being happy that's a different story  that's about it  oh that's easy probably when I had my face injured when I was in the military yeah I wish I could erase that I mean something that I see everyday when I look in the mirror I don't dwell on it it's just there but it is a mark on my face that I didn't deserve  he knows a traumatic experience but it's been about  I'm a 15 years or so it's been quite a while but if I could erase it yeah that would be yet  yes I was in the Navy  for 4 years  19  didn't have any other options it really wasn't  planning on joining the military but I didn't want to go back to school at the time I just figured you're going to the military with give me the background that I needed and money for school so that's about that shows  yeah  I mean can change it I mean I'm not unhappy I'm at a lot of nice people you know so that was good but there was some issues that I had the military that I had not went you know probably would you know when a lot differently but you know you can't change the past  no glad I did it I'm not really for that uptight person  yeah it's unfortunate you know but now I did it  the transition where was it was a little difficult at first you know having to adjust having a fine at the all career and you just  not having that  how do you say  I guess I felt like comfort in the military because I knew that I was always going to have that pay check it out when I was supposed to do I always have a roof over my head you know things like that you know the civilian life basically  it's your meds you don't know like you lose your job Monday or you know whatever so that's alright transition I got used to it pretty quickly  thank you  I went to school I started working with a Communications company  I did some medical care as well  got married and have children  maybe a little bit more responsible I know that for a fact you know if people my age at the time you know didn't have a lot of responsibility most of my still living at home you know at early age I was out on my own no pay my own bills things like that so it did get a little bit more responsibility  I'm feeling okay  I already have any complaints  I mean I feel fine I don't have any complaints about my life you know it is what it is to take it one day at a time that's about it  yeah probably nothing really to speak about  cheetah and thought  yeah  nothing dramatic  whenever you go to sleep I usually go right to sleep well. As soon as my head hits the pillow but you know I don't I don't talk to her or anything like that  very cranky  very cranky Laura boy I guess  no not at all  no not at all  I feel like I'm always happy I don't know if people tell me that all the time and say I'm always smiling and things like that so probably just morning when I woke up  thank you  my mother as much as we argue you know she's such a strong person and you know she's really been there for me and my kids and I just love when she isn't the person you know how she's always doing things for people to see  you know just a good person  she means well  but she's very opinionated  probably  Billy Anna how is he is driving  he probably say I'm typing to look gullible  I don't think that's what she would probably say  I don't know could be  I want our family vacation we actually drove which was different we usually fly so it was a new experience you know going on the road with the kitties  thank you  wow that's a tough question  oh I didn't really  oh you're welcome  bye  I press the button  that last question I didn't really answer it but she said thanks got it so I left it at that  I don't know what thank you for  should I get an answer  okay sorry  oldest recorded is Ian sorry  they're going to think I'm bored
366,male,0,0,"so she's going to chat with you going to bring that doorbell back over here sounds good  hi I'm Ali  creative  I'm not a  you  and please feel free to tell me  are you okay with  okay  I'm great and you  a Los Angeles California  I like the diversity I feel La by itself is a country there's so much to do so much to explore and there's nothing like it  traffic I would say traffic and it real estate prices are kind of crazy compared to the rest of the country  I have traveled I have traveled a bit I like to travel more though so I've been to a few countries  like what I've been to most of Europe at the continent I've been to London I was born here but my family from Nigeria so I've been to Nigeria a few times I've been to Denmark Amsterdam I've been to World sci-fi. Germany and I think that's it that's it yeah that's it  what do you enjoy about  just exploring exploring new places sing new things meeting new people a different culture it's definitely gives you an appreciation for life and the diversity of it and also going to countries that may not be as adult as the USA definitely definitely gives you a greater appreciation of you know what this country  okay well let's see London I accidentally actually when I first heard about going to London I really didn't care for it cuz I know much about it the only thing I remember is watching Mary Poppins and but when I went there I absolutely fell in love with it just  if I have the hustle and bustle of LA but at the same time you can go to very very slow pace we didn't do any driving we just went on the tube which is there are like the underground subway station which I absolutely fell in love with and just exploring different parts of the city we went to you know Big Ben Westminster Abbey they actually had when I went there the other premiere of the movie with us Slumdog Millionaire and also they had to Premier for seven seven pounds is a movie with Will Smith they did so Will Smith was over there and we were you know me and my friends are like I like screaming like we were like groupies just so you know just so you know your antics but yeah  yeah  business management and an option in Human Resources management what that means I have no idea  the question I've always avoids want to go into business and I've always want to study Finance but I didn't think I would learn too much about Finance from  College purse I think I've learned more in the real world whatnot so that option was human resource in the morning fasting about you know relationships and people always like reading articles about that stuff so I went for that  well I still I still kind of use what I've learned but I I work in Property Management so  anything to do with people I'm fascinated about so yeah  I love my job  say it's virtually made for me  how to get one my dream job wow  I would say being a life coach  I'll tell ya I would say about my dream job because I love helping people become successes and I helped I love being a part of someone else's success even the regardless of how small it is I'm will it be words of encouragement or helping somebody figure out a situation I like I just like helping people have a better life so I think you know idea for Friday for free like all day yeah  more outgoing definitely more outgoing I'm usually the life well it's weird cuz I'm usually considered like the life of the party I'm the one who is cracking jokes and making everybody laugh at the same time I can be very very quiet and to myself so  I turn on the fish tank screensaver I know it's not Hawaii  what do you do  to relax I usually listen to music  Asia listen to music to relax me or I pray  try to relax myself or listen to some really calm music so yeah  very good very very good I used to I want to say was a bad temper but I was known to  go off quot and quot not throwing chairs anything like that but  I'm a very patient person  once that patient is gone and for you to do that you have to really really really really push my buttons for a long time and once it's done I I just go off  no no  the last time I argue with someone while having argue with me long time  boy  I argued with my  no I would see my I think my dad I argued with them about  we were disagreeing on some things about when we're going to supposed to go back to Nigeria  and he wasn't listening to it was kind of a group discussion myself in my my siblings and he was being very subjective he wasn't being open to other people suggest engine suggestions and concerns  so it started an argument  very  I would say angry per se but I felt very  come like I was losing control  like a mom to type while I like to be in control of my emotions in my thoughts and I feel  once that patience is gone and I start going to off it's kind of like this  yeah I'm called a blur but I'm very witty and quick with what I say so I'll instantly say something that you know  how to say hurtful but I'm very direct and to-the-point make sure I get my point across  I have three brothers one one younger to older I am very close to my family and my mom's are my best friends  my brothers are great love them to death my father and he's more thought of it picture  what's something you feel guilty about  I don't I don't really I'm not the guilty pipe I don't feel guilty I'm not one to shy away from what I've done and I definitely own up to add you I'm not one to shy away from responsibility I don't think I ever feel guilty  Frank thing I do  yeah I don't think I feel good I usually don't feel guilty  pretty easy pretty easy at yeah I'm pretty good at falling asleep except when I'm excited while I'm reading from check when I'm going to focus on learning something like I'll read and read and read it when it's past my bedtime but now I'm going to work on  waking up much earlier than when I am now and it's kind of a little bit of a struggle but I'm getting to it so  I've been feeling I've been feeling fine you know I'm generally a very very happy disposition and sell  no yeah deep depressing moods nothing like that whenever if I feel do feel like I'm going I don't know allow myself to go to that place  have you been diagnosed with depression  thoughts  I would say  it's I want to say necessary changes by same or so behaviors learning how to  let go of past decisions may be that kind of how they they play their course in my life  I just said sometimes I kind of look back and say what if I did this what would have how would life be now now so that doesn't that's it  designing your  regrets no no there's anything I regret  Dennis 20 years ago  I would say don't be afraid of Who You Are  I'm be authentic more imprinting with yourself  erased from my memory  that's a good one  restore my memory  I would say what I say oh my tell my dad that he should act like a father  maybe I should yeah there was a  that was actually one of the times I am by the time I went off with him mom basically I had decided not to go to a private not to go away for college  I want I decided to stay local so I can look after my little brother  and my senior year I was overloading with everything I had maybe like for AP classes I was working if I was working three jobs at the time and was also on track and field so needless to say I was and I'm  I wasn't doing well in AP Calculus because I decide to go to a JC first and transfer also the save money for college to and when I told him you know the teacher called Sing us falling asleep in class because mind you after school I work an 8-hour shift cuz I was a retail manager at the time so I come home after that ship to do homework calculus let alone so he would get upset and I told him I spoke my accounts already told him that I don't need that class to go to the JC but that's okay I'm going to continue with some just going to I can't drop out at that point in time so I'm just going to let you know  yeah I'll discuss take the dfl whatever and he didn't he didn't like that cuz he is a teacher  and so he started blaming like my jobs and wanted to call my boss and it was it was just too much and I told him yeah sure my father should act like it but I was supposed more aggressive  one thing I do remember I do regret one thing  and that is I wish I continued with college throughout  like I I I burnt myself out I'm out spreading myself too thin nails actually I was actually on track to graduate from college at Wednesday 19 starting college classes in high school starting sophomore year in high school but with that that stuff enough stuff for Dad and working I just kind of like stop going to school for a while just worked if I went back to finish so but maybe that's one small thing but that's something small down  yeah  I'm very I'm a very compassionate and understanding person  I like learning new things I'm a very very happy person people come to me for advice I'm very objective I'll tell you the good the bad the ugly  and yes those are my best qualities  man found a way to have fun in any situation I can make light of any situation like I'm the kind of diapers I can break the tension in the room that sort of  that sort of a  personality trait  wish I was taller  beside my Heights  I wish  Maybe  I don't know if it's that be more I want say be more in touch with my emotions I think I would say understanding people's how people feel about me in their shoes  I think that would be one thing because I'm the type of person wear  people say that they love me or care about me and I'm like okay great thank you I appreciate that I don't realize how much they do I think that's not realizing how much they care and love me that's one thing I would like to  get more of a grasp on  my best friend she described me as someone who's funny crazy objective boil  ambitious hard-working  mean why is Lake Joseph you're so mean  just I just I I I just like to I joke around all the time and so  we were right now at your planning a friend of mine or friend of ours a baby shower  I'm giving her some ideas and as another friend who is invited who we have some issues in the past and someone I don't talk to her hang out with we should be really close finally talks in person but don't mind them being there  so she also talked about having celebrating her birthday  also, like after the baby shower  and there is another friend whose birthday was before the baby shower we wouldn't do anything for and I'm like well we're celebrating this person's birthday might as well we should definitely you know on at this person's birthday as well since we're closer to the person is his birthday passed and I said you know what just when we celebrate everybody's birthday forget the baby shower just doing a birthday and said you're so mean but she was laughing about it  most proud of them in my life I would say being there for my family being bing them immensely any emotionally strong person family's gone through a lot of challenges and a lot of times I've been the one to make sure everything goes okay and everything makes everything make sure everything goes accordingly so I'd say more than anything make sure I'm there for my family  okay  thank you  bye have a good one  I took the top off"
315,male ,0,2,okay okay alright okay you  Inglewood California  yeah  no  that's okay  give me my girlfriend and my daughter  yes  are OKC okay cool  yes I do  well I'm football recruiter so I travel all around the world to to sign different football players for sports management company  I'm just the Independence about it being alone being able to be free and not tied down to one to one thing you know it's great  I'm I remember traveling to  and take them to clubs and this and that and we're not that type of organization  dishonesty I don't like when people are dishonest that really really really bothers me and not true not on its not real that that upsets me a lot  I tend to just  try to free myself from the situation to clear my mind when usually take a walk or something like that or just just just go in the room by myself and just try to clear my head in my head  I'm okay with it at times but I can definitely be better  oh I already argued with my my lady a couple days ago and it was about our daughter in summer thing she's doing at school and she she wants to raise her one way and I think I want a razor a kind of a different way and discipline her a little more on certain situation so I think different discipline is a big key in a kid's life and she she she was raised a little differently  I don't know just angry upset you know when you're an argument that's what you feel so you do and say things that that that bother you and you just go on with it  yeah a little bit  I don't know I just  that's the way I feel I don't know I can't really say this way I feel  a little a little  I don't know just  realness  honesty truth to spend straight out front  I'm pretty clothes pretty clothes for my family  Oh Holy Night the subjective  they're raised different societies going to become even Wilder what the way the kids are raised and no discipline and and the things they're doing everything we we stay live and everything's inflated so much to where it's a skin to a point where it's getting out of hand I think kids these days to a certain extent are or much wilder than I was and and generations before me and just able to do and say and the lack of respect and in all just education-wise is this I think it's just tough times for kids and in the way they act it's it's it's ridiculous to me  I definitely like to watch sports I like to gamble I I like to travel but I can skate I like kind of like a a guy that likes to see different sites and go different places like that I'm a big movie person so I like going to theater stuff like that  I'm actually living it I always wanted to be in in some kind of sports industry and that's what I'm doing now I just my goal was to get a little higher and a ladder and you know my own sports management company but I'm doing pretty well for myself so I am happy yeah  no  no  no  it's okay that's it's pretty easy  irritated  Tire  I don't know it's been awhile it's been awhile couple weeks ago  how would you say  no not really  I think he would describe me as a stand-up guy I try to be a good loyal friend and  and I don't think you would describe me like that  school went to school grew up together I've been knowing all my friends for 3 months on my life  there  a very close with my friends and I are very close together still at this age  I'm honest loyal very loyal  I am a hard worker I think I am  tooth hurts and I'm just not the average guy I'm pretty much I'm a different different breed I just carry myself and act a little different from a normal guy  I don't know I just saw it but I was raised and high on my dad was kind of different and he didn't go with the In Crowd and I think I learned that from me and my Lawton and it's just it's it's kind of  same path I took  yes a lot of things I regret I regret  a lot of dishes in my life  yeah one  I actually let a a lady in my life goal years ago that I thought was my soulmate and we had a big argument and one thing led to another and we decided to take a break and then not in that break I I start dating somebody else and I told her I'm going to go my way and she go away I think that was a big a bad decision very bad decision  you've done anything to avoid you have totally I think I should have took a step back and really just thought about the situation a little more instead of a  being so upset and moving forward  I just upset I tend to get upset and then my thoughts get clouded so I need to think a little more when I'm upset  I don't know just  experience a Time been do you know making it making up for your mistakes and and then in  being better about different decisions after you made the mistakes  think a little harder by situation about situations and and things and the decisions that you make us think a lot longer and harder before you may come and I think the outcome will be in a little different today  my grandmother she's always been a positive influence she's a great black woman with old school  the ways of living so I think I have a bad at that to my life is a great woman  and baseball and yeah  I was a pretty good player I was a pretty good athlete growing up I was one of the top  and that started a future event and Athletics and that's what I wanted to do so I accomplished my girls who at the time was a great a great thing and still is a great thing it's a great accomplishment of my life  accomplishments being able to fry or if I'm  have a goal or something I'm supposed to do that week or that day and I compliment it always puts me in a good mood or getting my job done and out the way I'm supposed to do it in this in a timely fashion always with mega ball  being a positive role model right now for younger kids that's in our Sports Academy program I think

is a pot of positive of going to my life  oh  couple days ago my football team where in the playoffs make the playoffs so I always makes me happy  thank you  I get by  finished

346,female,1,23,yes  i'm okay  here in los angeles  there's a lot of things to do i love the beach  um i love the i love that it's sunny all the time  um the amount of people  um  that's really about it the amount of people  just a little  i just like um going to new places and just discovering new things  um i recently went to new york i was there for about three months  um and it was extremely boring i went to western new york  um and it was extremely uh snowy and um  i didn't <didn> was in a position where i didn't have a car so i didn't get to go very many places and i was in a small town   so um  i uh  uh it was beautiful for what i got to see but really  it wasn't really much to it <laughter>  yeah  um  both i'm both an introvert and an extrovert  um  i really enjoy doing things by myself  um  i um have a lot of my own um my likes and dislikes and i've spent a lot of time alone even though um i have <ha> i do have a lot of friends and uh when i do go out i i do tend to meet a lot of people but um i also enjoy um being by myself a lot  um  probably outgoing creative um  talented  um fun trustworthy  um  i studied language um  and um physics  and um  math no i'm not  i'm actually um i'm um i'm trying to be an actress  it was something that i fell into when i was a teenager  scrubbed_entry and uh i really enjoyed doing it and i hadn't done it for years um  so i figured why not i just came back to california and might as well try something that i did enjoy really doing   um so far um i just got picked up by an agent  so i haven't really done anything yet as an adult  but um  i'm hoping  hoping something it'll be fruitful   um  <sigh> i really don't haven't had too many  um  i guess my sister she's done really well  um  my boyfriend he's a  he's a very positive human being  um  but um  really i haven't had too many positive influences  um  i'm close i mean we <w> we hang out um i i don't tell them everything  um they're kind of judgmental  but um  other than that i mean i mean we hang out i mean i see them every day  um  geez um  it's kinda hard for me to relax um i mean i try to watch t_v um and i read  a lot um  that's probably about it i read i do a lot of sleeping <laughter> i'm a little depressed so um  yeah it's kinda it's xxx like i said it's really hard for me to relax  um  it isn't  um i tend to think a lot  um about the things that stress me out  um i've been through a lot of a lot of stuff so um  yeah so i i don't i don't i don't sleep very well at night and if i do fall asleep i wake up all through the night usually with some kind of anxiety attacks  um  i dream a lot about um the stuff that has uh  has affected me throughout the years so um  it's usually you know like i i'll dream about something that stressed me out and then i'll wake up and my my chest'll hurt    um  or just i just can't sleep all night because i just think i seem to be i don't know if i'm afraid to go to sleep  but i uh <sigh> i just i don't know i feel like that <th> that's a vulnerable place for me  because of stuff that've happened to me  so um  i i so i sleeping is just not really something i do well  um  tired  i'm uh  i'm moody i'm very sensitive  um  i uh i'm just negative <ne> a negative person  um which really that's not me um  i uh yeah i'm like <l> judgmental is not me either um i just  i'm just not a not a nice person to be around  um  i try to <t> i i spend a lot of my time reading i try to go out and do um i force myself to go out and do things um  just to keep myself involved  um so that i don't uh sit <si> just sit around and and and dwell on the fact that i can't sleep and i i try to um get myself as exhausted as i possibly can  um by running around and and and doing things  so  um it's difficult  um i do like there is a part of me that doesn't wanna  i don't really wanna go out and do things i have to actually force myself to um if i have make appointments i uh  i make appointments to like for auditions or or um  even to do this i um i i tend to uh  just not  like at the last minute i'll i'll try to convince myself not to go <laughter> but then i force myself to anyways   yes  um i've been diagnosed for two instances  um i was diagnosed <dia> diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago  and then i was diagnosed again um in august um  the first time it was um  i just wasn't sleeping <sl> because of the not sleeping um   and the uh just the stress <st> the unbelievable stress  um  and then the second time it was a xxx uh once again i started with the not sleeping um and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me um  and i just i i just couldn't take it anymore  so i i figured um  i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um  not thinking life was worth it and and i i i that's i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated  yeah  it was  i no <n> do not um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um  get out of my environment  um and uh  and that seemed to help a lot  um  and uh out here i i was i just the counselors that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much  um they just  they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and i don't believe that that's what i needed  um  yeah so um  yeah  <sigh> stressed um uh lately i've been really sad and i don't know why   um  but like i said i've been trying to combat that by um   keeping myself busy  um  actually um  i'm kind of a couple days ago  i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy   um but then i went back to  being you know going back to feeling miserable  so um  well i realized  i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep  and um  i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky  um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me  and uh  you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that  and that made me really happy  um  yeah  thank you <laughter> oh geez um  i've had so many years of just  just bad just a lot of bad  that it there has it's been a long time  since i've been proud of anything  i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through  um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've  gotten rid of themselves a long time ago  but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um  there's gotta be a silver lining  so  um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh  i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people  and um  and truthful and i still i still have drive in me  yeah  ugh <sigh> so much um  my last marriage um not getting out when i should have  um  and uh just i regret a lot <sigh> um the any situation that would've had a red flag um  eh just get out of it you know eh some things just don't work and um  no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um  i i would tell myself um to um  that it's not selfish  to let go of a bad situation  and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself  so if had i known that then had had i known that then i i i probably would've done better in life so  yeah  <sigh> um people who um  when people are down on me for my faults  um that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people steal still relive when i'm trying to forgive myself um  people who are mean to other people uh people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy um just anybody who picks on the little guy  um  you know people who don't care about the environment or animals um  i just <jus> i think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be  and uh it's it's disheartening and it it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make um everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do  and uh i that makes me mad  <laughter> i vent <laughter> um  yeah i tend to vent and then uh  and them um and then it's usually over i try not to bad mouth people um i try to just talk through it until um until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore mm i try not to get angry um  because i have a really bad temper and it um  and it can get outta hand so um  what i do is i i <laughter> something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap  um <laughter> if i'm not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap um i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind and come back to it  um  it was a couple days ago it was actually with my mother um  it was about um  actually she thought that i had taken a shirt from her  and um she was screaming and yelling at me and um  i was i was tired um i was it was late and um  i started to yell at <a> back at her you know because i was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty um  and you <yo> <sigh> it's uh going back to my past you know when i was younger and you know i didn't care about you know people's things and i would just kinda take and do whatever i wanted to and i'm not i'm so far from that person   um and i it it hurt me so i got mad and i and i started to yell and argue  mm kinda petty and stupid but  at the time it it seemed  it seemed uh  viable  um  hmm one of my most memorable experiences  um  god <go> i've had so many um  maybe it was um  i don't know um  it was  probably um  graduating pharmacy school  um i felt pretty great i didn't know if i was doing  uh very very well or not um and i ended up getting like on my last test scores i getting <get> ended up getting like ninety eight percent  and um  i uh  i actually i didn't <did> i had no confidence <laughter> that i had done well in class in school at all and i i didn't even know how i was getting the grades i was getting um so that was a really big accomplishment for me um  and uh

thing  um  sometimes actually i forget that i have any good qualities but  um  and just  i uh  all around i try to be you know as as good and the best person that i can be to other people and myself um  yeah  um  going to comedy shows  um  just um  having moments where you just laugh with people  um  sometimes just reading puts me in a good mood uh  i don't know probably that's about it  uh huh  okay  thank you  bye
481,male,0,7,<synch> yeah i am um good to moderate los angeles yeah i'm from um just a lot of different kinds of people and um eh i love the weather most of the time and um great creative scene i'm i'm really into music so um it's a great scene for that i i don't like driving <laughter> i don't know who does right i it's just it's just such a drag and uh getting from point a to point b is just a daily need and it doesn't get any easier it's too many people too many people <laughter> <laughter> i can't see your shoes um uh yeah when i can uh when <whe> when i can afford to um <sigh> just being somewhere else not having to drive usually most places have better public transportation um just i love <lo> i'm you know i'm a culture junkie i like experiencing different types of cultures so that's xxx um well you know i haven't been to that many places i've been to like mexico and italy it it's uh you know i wanna go to more places i wanna go to japan so that'll be that'll be interesting it's usually just with my family um it's my mom sometimes my girlfriend sometimes my brother and we just uh yeah we go to italy we spent two weeks there though that was cool yeah um living next to the best gelato shop in italy in we <w> we were in florence <f> when we were in florence spent uh spent a week in florence that was great very very good uh culture there as well art studied uh film and digital media 'cause uh i make music and i wanted to learn how to make music videos so it's something i'm trying to get into uh yeah yeah i mean i need to get a camera though that's the thing uh but um i mainly my main focus is music i studied film but my focus is music um yeah <y> sure i've been playing music i've been playing guitar uh keyboard bass drums for um for about twelve years now and uh i do uh production and songwriting i'm in a indie rock band scrubbed_entry um that's a great website i highly recommend it and it's uh it's mine so check it out uh international rockstar music producer and uh filmmaker director probably outgoing um just just feel like it's a way to get the best <be> most out of life uh just talking to people and learning about them and having them learn about you and care about you it's uh kinda just goes with the territory <caritor> territory <laughter> <laughter> yeah um i uh do meditation and uh it's not really hard 'cause it's fun and it it relaxes me and helps me focus at the same time which uh you know that that was a huge epiphany for me that you can relax and focus at the same time 'cause normally when i'm relaxing i'm i'm tuning out i'm focusing on something else but um to be able to combine those sensations was uh yeah i've been doing that for about uh three months now so yeah it is um almost too good at times <laughter> uh sometimes uh there's things that should be said that i that i don't um just because um you know it's like you're opening up a can of worms maybe one of your friends for example i got a problem with him but they don't have a problem with him necessarily 'cause he didn't do anything to them and uh i've had to deal with that in the past sort of a awkward social situation but um you know i make do um <makes sound with mouth> probably argued with uh the guitarist from my band uh we had a falling out we're not gonna be in a band together i mean we're still friends so at least there's that mm but um it was just basically about creative control of the project and how we're gonna prioritize it in in our lives and uh you know we just our priorities weren't the same and i got very upset so that was the end of that um <sigh> i felt good that it was definitive that it was you know a choice had been made on both parties uh also regretful that you know he didn't feel the way that i wanted him to feel about it which was excited about the project so the fact that he wasn't really in it kinda pissed me off um but i got over it um and you know i got some other people that are really really excited to be working with me you know even honored so you know i'm uh i'ma keep going thank you um <sigh> hmm i don't know i don't really i don't really have any regrets like that at the moment i can't really think of any um <deep breath> um when i was in high school i cheated on my girlfriend i didn't think it would mean anything at the time but i did it i i regret it but um you know xxx you know life happens you make some mistakes selfishness um being young and thinking it wouldn't matter um you know thinking you know you only live once and you know for eh it was probably for the best ultimately 'cause you know i love my current girlfriend and i would never do that to her so that was <wa> that was years ago but uh she was a nice girl she didn't deserve that so i regret it <deep breath> um shit geez um i guess uh whether to go to college or not 'cause uh i uh i had some projects going in l_a that i didn't really wanna shut off uh i i had a band going we had a manager um we were playing out a lot and i wasn't sure if i wanted to keep that going or go to school and start over and um i made the decision to go to school in santa cruz and and start a new life there for four years and it it was a difficult decision but i'm glad i did 'cause i met a lot of people a lot of people i'm still close with today that you know we work on stuff together and all that so it's good i agree it is good <laughter> thank you <laughter> um maybe i wish i could forget getting spanked in the parking lot when i was four by a danish babysitter uh you know on the abuse scale it's pretty low but it was somewhat humiliating and i i don't forget it so i have a pretty vivid picture of it and i'm i'm i'd be happier if it wasn't there it's positive they're supportive um they give me a hard time sometimes because they don't think that i keep things in perspective in terms of how i'm gonna support myself even though i do it's just um you know i have a a more long range picture than they do and i have faith in myself and the creative projects that i make so yeah there's a bit of tension there just 'cause you know they expect certain things from me and i expect them as well but i just have a different way of going about it than they might prefer but they're sweet people how do i cope with them uh i you know they're lovely people at their core you know um cope with them 'cause i love them i just uh you know at times i'll just uh go off on my own for a while and eh you know take a breather whatever you know xxx everyone makes you mad sometimes so <deep breath> challenging um <sigh> i just i try and it doesn't work um sometimes i have to take medication for it i have to take ambien something like that um yeah it's difficult <di> i'm someone who sleeps in late so i always get at least six or seven hours if i have to wake up early for something um i get nauseous sometimes i'll throw up in the morning um yeah i've had jobs where i'd wake up and you know vomit while i'm brushing my teeth it's horrible it does suck um it's kinda something i'm worried about you know i i kinda need to get some part time work while i'm not you know getting a steady pay flow for my music production so yeah <sigh> it's pretty rough <sigh> got some stuff i need to get over i'm not really sure how just not feeling good getting nervous when you know there's something stressful like a stressful work environment or just something i that doesn't sit well with me like being in a you know a a rushed and you know stressful work environment it just um unless it's about something that i care about you know like music or the arts it's just very hard to to give a shit frankly like and you know i i try to psych myself into giving a shit and it just makes me sick you know maybe i'll have a red bull or something and you know xxx my body doesn't want that in the morning it just i feel like my body rejects things and yeah okay i've been feeling okay very uh very reflective very contemplative you know there's gonna be some changes and there's gonna be some new people in my life some new people uh in my band um you know i'm gonna try to push myself but try to stay grounded at the same time 'cause you know i expect more from myself it's just pissing me off when my get my you know i basically feel like i'm shitting all over myself my body's shitting on me anyway just by being so um shitty <laughter> yeah no yes um i was diagnosed um about uh twelve years ago i haven't been in therapy since um they gave me zoloft and i didn't like it it made me feel worse than i do in the shittiest moments i was telling you about it it uh it made me feel numb um i don't wanna feel numb i wanna feel everything even if it sucks being forced to it was a private school they thought i was acting up thought i was a uppity kid i think i was just being a kid so yes i do um well i haven't been in in twelve years but i do think that it might be helpful for me in the future i thought you weren't a therapist that's a typical therapist question right there <laughter> um well yeah i uh uh i i kinda wanna go back to therapy it might help might help me find some solutions maybe maybe it's not a therapist i need maybe it's a life coach i have no idea but i'll be seeking help soon um yesterday i was watching a movie with my girlfriend and i looked over at her we smiled at each other and it was it was it was great yeah um very honest um sometimes brutally so but i'm a good guy i think that my friends all think i'm a good guy probably funny um open-minded um i guess well it's what i'm working on which is trying to improve my discipline and try to work through my body rejecting shittiness of the world <laughter> it gets better <sigh> um stay in shape it gets harder the longer you wait um don't give up on your dreams keep doing what you're doing my music you're welcome nice talking to you

405,female,1,17,essential let you know and then you can let me know okay thanks  thanks  go ahead and move his cord behind you didn't get any way  hi hello  are you okay with this  yes  okay not too bad  I'm from Chicago South Side  I'm back in 1978 when I was 18  lately not much maybe once every two or three years  compared to the letter A  it's totally different you know horrible weather and  it's just a whole different atmosphere  let's see my mother had moved to Africa  I graduated from high school and I had a friend down here so I just thought well let me try la  very easy actually yeah I loved it from the moment I got off the airplane  number one the weather son is very important to me so I love the weather  I don't know just kind of a more laid-back atmosphere variety  of people  and now it's my my Homebase you know my friends that are family  that's how I like my family is here now  I guess the small hug earthquakes  traffic  just basic things like that really  I don't currently but I did throughout my life I travel quite a lot  I just seeing seeing other cultures and seeing more history and meeting people and  just fun at the fun of it as well  let's see what one trip I went to England  Ireland and Scotland and France all in you know one trip  so that was a nice variety  I guess you could say probably skiing in val de saire France  that was fun I'm glad I got to do that  that's great  do you consider yourself more shy  I'm kind of shy by Nature I've tried to grow out of being shy so I'm not fully shy but I was always an extremely shy child  but now here in Culver City this is my environment and I I guess you could say I'm not really shy and in my hometown of Culver City  I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got  to relax I like to just curl up in my bed and read my book take a nap watch TV sometimes on the couch in the living room just you know stay at home and kind of vegetate  pretty good yeah my tempers pretty level  probably with my husband  and  I can't remember the moment what it was about  okay  tell me about your relationship with you  well when you say my family do you mean  my family from childhood or my current family  okay well I guess my current family comes to mind I have two daughters and my relationships pretty good it's okay with them but they're teenagers which you know going they're going through a lot of hormones and they can be kind of bitchy and  and but I have hope that you know they'll grow out of bed and soon someday we'll have a really good relationship  and then there's the husband which  like I guess I could face soon-to-be-ex-husband hopefully soon we need to get a divorce but we're still together due to financial reasons  and yeah yeah so that that's not good relationship with the husband but  but since we have determined that we need to divorce  we don't expect anything out of each other so we don't argue as much so that's good  well  I guess our marriage  I wish I had noticed early on that  you know it was like way off from what I thought it was  how do you say oh my God  hardest decision  I guess leaving my first husband that was pretty hard  well you know we were married and I wasn't content I guess you could say and  I kind of just gave up on our relationship and now that I look back I think it's because  I want children and he would have been happy to never have any and so since I didn't have a father it was very important that I create children with someone who really wanted to be a father and so I was kind of at an age where I needed to start thinking about having children yet I was with someone who really was not into it so that I think that's one maybe the core reason why I was not content and I just felt like this marriage isn't going to work n so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not want to break up and  and I had to leave him because I just wasn't happy and that was that was very hard cuz  yeah  felt like I was hurting him which which I was him he survived he got over and now he's married with two kids but it was hard to leave him  tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from your memory  something I wish I could erase from my memory have to think about that  I'm sure there's something well  yeah there's some  I guess it'd be nice to erase from my memory a recent I'm not resend but an event in my  recent adulthood here in Culver City where one of my best friends  betrayed me by back years ago when my husband first got into real estate she and her family were growing and they really need a larger home and  we just assumed that you know that they would use my husband as their agent supposed to sell their current home current at the time and purchase a new home  and as it turned out they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent and yeah that was devastating  I don't think I've ever been betrayed like that so I wish I could erase that not cuz now you know this was back when the kids were really young  and  my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was let's say  6 Maybe  maybe five anyway her and my best friend's daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other we were pregnant together and they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we run into them in the neighborhood are they run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were just you know like two peas in a pod even those her their moms weren't talking to each other anymore so now they're 13 and 14 and they're in middle school together and they're still very connected in fact she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl and it's just a little awkward you know cuz now these girls are becoming really good friends  your friends and yet I still have this  bad memory of what her  her mom did to to me  that was about 1:10  about 8 years ago  I tried it I try to ignore it and put it out of my head which have been able to  in recent years  but obviously it still comes up  anyway that was that  not that easy I do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time I wake up and can't get back to sleep but or I finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up you know that that difficult thing  well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom and then  you know it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then I wake up again to go to the bathroom  so I guess that's the trigger as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there I don't know I think there's just too much on my mind running through my mind and the day I feel like I haven't accomplished enough during the day so  it's hard for me to just go to sleep when I'm supposed to guess  well I'm kind of used to it now so I just go on to the day probably looking looking tired and  like I'm kind of used to feeling tired I just do what I need to do and sometimes if I'm able to if I'm at home and don't have huge commitments yeah I might just like I said earlier just take a nap or something read my book watch TV whatever  lately have I been feeling  kind of down  on myself down on life  well I have this pending need for separation / divorce  I'm worried that I made a lot of mistakes with my girls now they're teenagers you know on the verge of adulthood  and so I worried that you know I did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance in their early childhood and now it's too late  like I missed out on a lot of things  and yeah I need a job I'm unemployed I don't know what I want to do with my life I know I want to do something and I just wish you know I never did finish college unfortunately because I was traveling and stuff  so I regret that extremely  and I need to get a job and be able to take care of myself cuz I need to  divorce and move on with my life so now I forget what the original question was but that's the state part of the state of Mo  no  yes  well  the first time or or or recently  the first time I guess was you know when I was in my early twenties I was just a little upset about constantly that was another breakup I had to make back then I was  in my early twenties and I needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting cuz I  you know it's hard because he didn't want to break up and I feel like I was hurting him and I didn't understand this feeling I was really upset  how did that was my first time having depression so I didn't really recognize it as depression but I went somehow I had the  knowledge or the I was able to take myself to a psychiatrist I remember I paid for her by the hour and she prescribed Xanax to just help relax me  and so I guess that helped me get through that and then I've had depression throughout the years just so you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as I guess it's usually a relationship you know  yeah so the most recent time I was diagnosed and put on meds that was probably about 2 years ago  no  money and I don't have insurance otherwise yeah I'd be happy to go to therapy anything that might help  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  last time I felt really happy  I don't know I guess maybe  when my children were born  I guess happy I just you know I always wanted children so it's nice  to have them  that's I don't know that's all I can remember of that and I guess I don't remember the good times too well I remember the bad times  something you did recently that you really enjoy  something I did that I really enjoyed  well  that's the way I am  Friday night I went to a friend's house and met up with five other girlfriends and we  we created vision boards and talked and had dinner at one of their house that was that was fun  we get to  stay in college get my degree  get therapy trying to become happy  yeah try to figure out things earlier in life  like  yeah  stay in college and and mainly I think the mean and what it all boils down to no matter what your depressed about it seems like  as soon as the saying goes in the  songs go you know it's all about money the world revolves around money in  having none that in itself is for depressing so besides relationships and different things that have happened in your life having no money as you know it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it so with that in mind I would definitely advise myself to get my college degree and to get a job and stick with it don't quit to go traveling and I'll just stick with a job sick with a company build up your seniority keep your benefits  and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of filled yeah that would have been my biggest piece of advice to myself  not much  I guess  just my daughter's you know there are two beautiful daughters and  I'm proud and glad that I was able to have children some people  aren't even able to do that you know and they try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so that's the one thing I mean I wanted five children and I always wanted a boy which I never had but I guess that's the biggest thing I can think of to be proud of  having my two daughters  I'm a very loyal  friend and person that's why when that friend betrayed me I was so devastating  yeah very loyal very  happy was I going to say I was going to say happy go lucky I don't know where that came from very I meant to say friendly and caring and  yeah I care about people  and I'm interested in people  and I care about animals as well actually that's another thing I'm proud of proud of being a vegetarian  yeah so my daughters and being vegetarian and I'm a vegetarian because I really care about feelings of other beings not only humans but animals to in  you know I don't think that animals should be tortured and live a torturous life just so we can eat them  so what was the question  remember the question  okay  you're welcome by  I did need the tissue one time so that's good  the other sister

really hard um   i don't usually sleep well so um yeah i have trouble falling asleep mostly  um i guess it's just like my mind will be racing a lot of you know sometimes it'll be flashbacks of bad memories um just you know thinking too much <laughter> um i don't know um i think just uh  stress you know a lot of stress every day just everyday stress uh yeah pretty much that's what triggers it

really bad if i don't get sleep yeah  yeah  thanks yes i was diagnosed um three years ago  uh i just i didn't really know what was going on then i realized okay well they just diagnosed that and um i was like okay well this is the problem and it i just wanted help because it just when your mind is after you like that's like it's just awful to have your mind taking control of you like that  yeah  yeah it's hard  um yeah yeah i definitely always thought i had a problem i always thought something was like really wrong um i just always like kinda nervous around people like i never can really like look anybody in the eye 'cause i'm just so nervous my eyes are always kind of like racing and i um would have sweats if i was in the situation um that reminded me of the situation like i just try to avoid what reminds me and brings those flashbacks yeah  oh um i i've been feeling good i've been getting out more every day i'm trying to um i guess walking keeps my mind off my p_t_s_d symptoms so i'm trying to walk more that helps  thanks um yeah i have depression um yeah  um it helps yeah it actually does help me a lot um i currently don't have one right now i'm actually getting a new one in

keep more occupied yeah it helps  um the last time i felt really happy um i guess um i don't know um today 'cause i mean i'm glad to be part of this <laughter>  um most proud of uh well <sigh> um i'm trying to think of what i'm most proud of um  i  think i'm most proud of like the fact that i am able to you know not be like well i mean most people i know they like deny that they have a problem and i'm proud that i can actually like you know be a person who can realize okay i have a problem and i need help but a lot of the people i know they don't take medication they're untreated and um they just don't wanna get any help and i'm glad to get help because i don't wanna feel that way and i wanna get help for the problem instead of doing that  oh gosh there's a lot i regret yeah there's a lot um i regret you know uh drug abuse you know but that's part of you know the p_t_s_d i regret um a lot uh mistakes you know relationships stuff like that  wow um i would've told myself to um i guess the advice i would've given myself was to  try to keep my mind more relaxed i guess yeah um well i'm a very nice person and i always like to smile people are always saying how i smile a lot but um the smile i guess it kind of hides like what's on the inside but you know i'm pretty depressed you know but i just try to keep smiling and i always like to lend a hand to help and make people feel better

like to play video games those are fun stuff like that okay thanks goodbye
381,male,1,16,okay thanks  hi I'm Ali thanks for coming in today  I was created to talk to people and it's safe  are you okay  yes  okay  from Santa Monica  other people mostly  all the people all suck  I know not a lot  I can't afford to travel as much as I'd like to  I was an English major  I just like reading a lot at the time so it sounded like the best thing well the most fun thing to study  no not anymore  I love my job you could only say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job  it's my dream job would be to manage a soccer club  always be pretty much impossible for me  I don't have any experience in that field  very shy  sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got  I play music  what I do when I'm annoyed I don't know  I do what I'm annoyed  I can't think of anything I don't know  I don't think I don't do anything specifically  I pretty good I would say very good I don't lose my temper very often  I was the last time I argued with someone  I can't remember  I don't have a lot of conflicts with people I can't remember the last time I argued with someone  well it see when I was  a little kid  I was outside my grandparents restaurant and there was a robbery and I saw it I what I saw it when when the robbers were leaving  that maybe I would want to erase it from my memory if I could  well I didn't know what was happening in that moment so I didn't feel so bad at the time but I felt bad afterward because then  you're my mother was upset by my mother was there and she had to call the police and it was it was disturbing to see her you know really disturb that way but at the time it actually happened I wasn't really upset was more the aftermath of it  consideration that  I don't know  all I can think about this probably a million situations that I would have I would say I would have handled differently I can't think of one in particular  Maybe  I think that when I was a kid  well I think that when I was at sea  well I have okay have a good one  I didn't marry the girl that I think that I should have married so that's a big one for me  yeah well we were together for about 4 years  and I think I just took her for granted when I just didn't commit  and them  that was a long time ago and now that it's been so many years I realized well I don't know they fight the realization but I think now that  that yes she should have been my wife that we were meant for each other are made for each other  but because my selfishness and because I just  I have this fear of commitment at the time I just felt like I didn't  they didn't do what I should have done with with a smart thing would have been  what's something you feel guilty about  well the last thing I can think of that I would say I feel guilty about was  now I feel a lot of guilt about my my friendships I'm not I don't feel like I'm as good of a friend as I could be but then at the same time I don't really know exactly what the  how I could be a better friend I just feel a little guilty that I'm not that I can't help people anyone who has a problem I can't I never feel like I can help anyone  who I know who has a problem so  how that happens every day I guess if that happens with everyone who I know and everyone  all of my relatives and all of my friends I don't feel like I can really give them anything or help them in their lives  tell me about your relationship with your  well there  it's very distant it's it's just it's very cordial and it's very  I don't know what the word is it's hot it's kept it a very surface-level I don't think that they know I don't think that my family really knows me very well at all  and I don't know them very well either not nothing to hide in a true sense  so  yeah it's  I think a lot of families are that way but it is it does bother me that mine is that way  how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep so it's very easy I sleep a lot and I  yeah I have no problem sleeping at all  no not really I would say  the way I'm now it's the way I think I've been my whole life so  you didn't when I was a little kid I slept a lot also and no I don't think I've changed much  I'm pretty down but like I said  in a way I could tell you how I'm feeling really down but then again I've always been this way so it's hard to say that it's down when it's consistently that way  yes  I would long time ago I was about 10 years old  around there about  I was just missing a lot of school I didn't want to go to school so we eventually they sent me to  to a therapist and then to a psychologist and then to a psychiatrist and  I want from there  you still go to therapy now no I haven't gone to therapy since I was a teenager  why did you stop  well I didn't feel it was helping me at all so one day I just  decided I didn't want to go anymore  affected you  well like I said it I didn't feel that it helped me  so I guess it's not enough that it affected me much  no I wouldn't say disturbing no  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  well I feel pretty happy whenever I see my nephew  and I have a  my best friend's children are I feel like their mind my nephew and my niece and I'm pretty happy when I'm around them  that's great  tell me how you spend your ideal weekend  my ideal weekend would be  I would probably be traveling I would  really enjoyed getting out of the city every weekend  it going anywhere really just anywhere out of the city  I just seen the way different people live and how people are different wherever you go I really do think people are different when you go to different places and  how they interact with you and how they see the world different food  and I also like historical places I mean to history and I and I enjoy this visiting anywhere that has some sort of  historical significance  awesome  I haven't taken a trip in a long time  the last trip I really took was I went to France a few years ago for a wedding  and I had a really good time there I had always wanted to go to Paris and so I got to go to Paris and then I went to a little town  what's a few hours away from Paris where the actual wedding was  I knew it was really fun I think that the church where the wedding was was like a thousand years old so  that was a really cool trip  I got to know I don't have it I don't know what's what would would be considered memorable  a memorable experience  probably the most memorable experience I guess which is be  nothing in particular but but living with the girl who I just who I told you earlier that I think now that we should have gotten married  that's something that stays in my memory that's why I'm saying it's memorable because  it's it's still with me in the  it's something that I don't think you know what I know I'll never forget but it's not any particular day or any particular moment  a lot  check it be healthier  for one thing and more energetic  and the more friendly I think I am pretty friendly  but more more outgoing more more more social  those two things mainly I guess that I would like to be more and more social more enthusiastic and more and healthier  that's a good question my best friend how would my best friend describe me I think  I think he would say that I am  a very cheesy but probably say that I'm a very spiritual person  and that I'm very giving I think I'm a lot more selfish than people think I am but people think that I'm not selfish  and probably he would say there in Creative also  put my advice to to myself I don't understand the question  is there anything you regret  yeah but we already talked about it  no I can't. I don't think I really believed in and being proud or in the end Pride  I don't think that it accomplishments are really something to be proud of but I can't really think of  any accomplishments  anyway even if I did have something to be proud of. I can't think of any any sort of accomplishment I've had  something I did recently that I really enjoyed  well I signed karaoke with a couple of friends of mine  I don't usually do that but  yeah that was a lot of fun a few days ago  thank you  I was more difficult than I thought it was going to be just kind of had me stumped a lot and a lot of the time and I was  I think I got better after a little while and I was  at first I thought I was going to get mad because I'm not saying anything and I don't know how to answer and
426,male,1,20,<sync. yes i'm alright south l_a um the weather the women the opportunities that's about it racism police brutality injustice that's it mm no not much of a exploring type of person um psychology mhm um it was one of the classes i excelled in the most so i decided to change it from business to psychology yeah yes no to own my own record label um it it's moderately hard but you know take it one day at a time just i guess you know stay focused a little bit of both um i tend to be shy in um situations i'm not comfortable with or i'm new to and i'm outgoing in places i'm more comfortable with yeah <laughter> um turn the lights down low and listen to soft music mhm i'm getting better over the years um i think i'm pretty decent now compared to how i used to be yes ma'am um due to the lack of i guess you could say controlling my emotions i have uh gotten incarcerated sent to prison yeah mm i'm not sure uh i don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision i've made in my life um it was probably a few days ago with the girl i was talking to and i was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness yeah uh frustrated because um you know uh you you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect you know the same effort by the other person when you're in a relationship and at the same time when you when you have expectations sometimes you kinda set yourself up for failure so you know i guess i'm just learning there's a lot of situations i would've handled differently um probably the most recent was uh i had gotten into a physical <phy> a physical altercation with an inmate when i was incarcerated and that made me that's what sent me to prison and and i had to do a lot more time and um if i handled it differently i probably would've never went to prison i probably would've been home a lot sooner than i originally happen yeah mm there are several events i wish i could erase from my memory um probably uh my first girlfriend um she did something really uh extreme it wasn't necessary in my eyes and it and it cost <co> it could've cost me my life i think that that that's a recurring thought that i i wish i could completely erase from my memory along with the good memories as well um a few you few fights uh i guess you could say shoot outs um getting jumped getting robbed you know those things i think those inhibit me i guess to to explore certain areas of life that i'm not comfortable with so those are the feww things that it'd be nice if i could erase it completely yeah <sigh> hurting people that didn't need to be hurt emotionally especially um a few women in my life or in my past um probably putting my mother through certain things that she didn't have to go through along with my close friends and family as well um used to be rocky growing up but as i got older and matured and the certain experiences that i've been through kind of brought me closer to my family so now it's it it's pretty decent it's it's pretty decent mm i would say my mother um yeah my mother um well she she uh she had her share of experiences negative and positive um i admire her the struggles she's been through um she she she uh experienced difficult economic hardships growing up but that didn't stop her um from raising a son at a young age finishing school getting her master's and just just overall being a a good person and she also battled mental health issues as well and um probably not the best of family that she could've been raised with so she so she's kinda of like a a inspiration to to me and other people as well so i would say my mother mm it's not easy so yeah it's not easy i couldn't tell you i i i've always had sleeping issues um i usually just take uh like over the counter sleep medication or nyquil but it makes you drowsy the next morning so it's like it's a negative effect really yeah the medication <medi> i don't know shit i don't know but i just stopped taking it 'cause i didn't like feeling drowsy not good at all um yeah i mean i recently got released from prison not too long ago uh i'm older now and a lot more responsibilities and i feel like my life is not where it's supposed to be i feel like i could've made a lot more better decisions in my life you know sometimes feeling sorry for myself and just things that i've been through and the whole nine yards so yeah it's all good yeah so true yes <sniffle> about two and a half three years ago <deep breath> <sigh> myself i um i was i was just tired of not i don't know i guess school kind of made me seek help because i started to understand myself how my brain works um you know so i decided to seek help maybe to better my life yeah you could say that yes i am yes yes i do actually i do mm better decision making um better tools to reflect on choices um how to control uh certain situations better yeah um <sniffle> well instead of just always reacting on emotion no matter what kind of emotion it is i step back and and and i assess the situation you know to see what's what's the best way to to react towards the situation and by doing that it has made me more mature emotionally more mature and just has a positive outcome <laughter> um i was lying next to a beautiful woman who who cared about me and the feeling was mutual so that was probably the most happy oh my goodness spontaneous um outgoing sometimes a little crazy um fun that's about it nothing um like i said earlier just you know hurting the the few women that were in my life my past and my friends and family that's about it oh shit uh school is really important um how i carry myself the people who i surround myself with and what i choose to do in my free time those are the few things i would tell myself good music um a good game of basketball um sex um i like going out i like going to parties um social gatherings where everyone's friendly and and there's no drama that's what i like dancing beautiful women a couple drinks that's about it um i guess not not necessarily giving up and and um just just i don't know just keep going just just not giving up really yeah mhm bye bye
456,female,0,6,"okay  occasion  yes  and well thank you  Boston Massachusetts  I moved to LA about a year after graduating college in 2001  quite often least a couple times a year  God I love both cities they are polar opposite in many many ways but there's things about both of them that I love  I have to pursue acting and writing  it's still not complete reality to me but it was actually very easy because of the the the the creative factor out here allowed me to pursue what I wanted to creatively and there's different the social culture was different in a way we're at from where I had grown up and it it suited me better my personality  I like the fact that you can come here and pursue any any niche of in creativity or art or entertainment that you want to and sort of make your own path I grew up where its nose constantly and is very very cold so sounds obvious but clearly I like that it's you can swim year-round and I like that it's there's always something to do no matter what day of the week it is  I don't like well I miss my Sam I miss that there's no I don't like that there's not a big family element here I miss I'm a big family girl I miss my family I feel like it's very crowded here but yet it's very easy to feel sort of isolated alone here  I'm sure you can  I can't see you she is but I do mostly just not up to much worldly travel mostly back to Boston and Florida where my parents live but I do enjoy traveling and take a lot of trips within California and around here  I just have an adventure do something fun or if I'm going home it means I want to see my family  oh my god well I like to drive up to Northern California go to San Francisco and family and friends they're always super super fun. In college I with my college boyfriend from Boston to eat we drove we went to San Francisco and drove down to LA and Las Vegas and that was kind of how I realize I wanted to move here so that was very that was ready I was a big one  in general  I guess it would be moving here I move to when I move to LA I got on a plane with didn't know anybody here and I just got I talk to a girl and I met online and agreed to be her roommate and she pick me up at the airport we never met and you know one of my dear friends to this day so definitely don't deflate out here was his big monumental  I felt powerful and excited and just open to whatever  telecommunications got a lots of every lot of different writing writing styles eventually graduated with a concentration in public relations and English minor  what made you decide to do  writing cursive writing  writer of I guess you could say writer-actress which is but I guess writing is first  hard very hard because you need to know he's going to push you to do what you have to be self starter you have to make it happen so it's very hard cuz I don't think that's that naturally in my personality I do but not as much as I need to  I would say are going on in general  pink screensaver  I sometimes take a walk if I feel tense listen ambient music helps if I need a soothing background white noise calming, area and just it's your basic depressed and just sort of take a minute to come back to it, Mitchell place  I am getting better at controlling my temper cuz I don't usually have a temper too often but when I do and I lose my cool I have a hard time controlling it  yes  no  argue with someone God  I guess it was a friend a friend a girlfriend if it wasn't it was about our  are each separate perspectives on a a certain situation between us but obviously very very different and it started out as something big and then we just realized this is this is stupid we don't need to be fighting about this so it kind of ended quickly  I guess it would have been with an ex-boyfriend fighting with an ex-boyfriend relationship stuff definitely losing my temper and making a situation escalated in a way that it didn't need to be I wish that I had just walked away from it  I don't know if I could have avoided the complete situation but I definitely could have  May the outcome much less  chaotic  I guess that would be  walking away from somebody who was definitely bad toxic from my life, but I really did want in my life and it was a true wrestling with morality and  kind of sort of growing out my coming to a point where I have to say I'm going to do something that's really really hard for sort of Me no short-term pain for long-term gain and I had to make sort of an adult decision relationship-wise but it was still carry over into other areas of my life and taught me that you know you're not always going to feel great every decision is not going to be easy and feel good  are you happy  yes  I was kind of forced to this issue was just what was going on in life was sort of can ignore those signs just yeah  I guess it would be a particular argument I had with somebody that happened to be in sorry about public place and got in trouble for it I wish I could erase  mileage to my family have a wonderful family completely blessed amazing parents have a brother and as he has a little girls have a baby niece that I love more than anything in the world and I could not ask for a better family therapy the idea  my parents for sure there's wonderful people and then stop by example and I feel like I'm a good mix of both of them  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  pretty easy I try lately it's been a little bit hard my sleeps been off but for the most part I've come to recognize the importance of it and it's it's been pretty easy  Lig fidgety maybe a little bit out of it I might might seem like I'm in a good mood cuz I might be a little Gideon laughing more just sort of high emotions but overall get irritated faster and just sweat more just feel feel just a little off  not really just try to be more focused get things done  I'm just trying to focus on what I want to do career-wise and really  stop wasting time or if you know just procrastinating and get things done and being inspired going and seeing you and being around people that are doing what I want to do and just carrying it over to my own life  no  no  oh just a couple days I was just in with my family and my baby niece in Florida and that's why I went down there to see her so it was just awesome I'm always happy when I see her  probably as very  funny humor would definitely probably one of the first things they would say joking always a little wiseass and my personality but they would describe me as always at unconditional there for them and just  they know they know that I'm there if they need them always  my drive be more driven and getting things done  I guess it would be bought a recent a recent ex boyfriend that was a mistake of a relationship  yeah sort of just  the they think because he the way he felt about himself certain things he would say and even though what he said didn't directly make me feel about the whole situation made me realize the fact that I'm even with this person made me feel like I'm allowing people into my life that shouldn't be there so I'm dumbing myself down and that

it was an everyday thing people are friendly finding out some things about my grandmother and her family were interesting  I studied poli-sci and sociology  what's the time it seemed like the easiest thing to do  now now  I have a dream job for a while I was doing sports research for our Native American tribes but I enjoyed it but that's so it's not as  as often as it was mainly because of the the Sports Bureau that exist now that didn't exist when I started  Crystal when I do I still enjoy it  I'll be with it but I'll be with suits me in any given situation  you intend I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got  what do you do  listen music  I like oldies Jazz soft music  I've learned it well I have a question I was at Wayne but I've learned to do it well  might want to bug you a super mean words but with my youngest daughter it was about a year-and-a-half ago  can you tell me about  where was stand over an incident I didn't like the way your husband said something to her and it bothered me and when I told her she got it extremely defensive and rather than deal with her when she became she became angry with me  I was mad  three girls

lose that but I'm in my parenting at this point in my life I'm enjoying my grandchildren when I was a parent that's a difficult job  getting getting to their level and understanding what they understand I don't understand and that putting your your stuff in front of theirs  hugs  well my dad was with physical and those days you know nobody called Child Services if you got hit  my mother was very loving you but my dad  I adored my mother my dad that was a hard guy but I love him  I never felt abused by him but I mean I'm the one thing I remember you said when you when you're capable of kicking my ass you can leave this house  that's my hope that Skyler the bases of a relationship  okay  my mother  my kids my grandkids  I'm one of them one of the three three sons really didn't have any experience with the females other than with my mother in terms of being the unrelated and my grandma and my first daughter was born I was like why was it so I'm madly in love with her  change my life  that's what happened  when my mother got sick I wish I wasn't there for her the way she should have been  but I don't feel good  oh yeah you can always fix what you do with you  I was just in a real bad situation  but that doesn't excuse the fact that I wasn't there the way I should have been  at least I Did It My Way  why my second marriage probably she she wanted to have children already had my children with my first wife and I had told her initially that I did not want to have children that you know I'm going to head 3 and I was good with that and she indicated that she did not want to have children  so we got married and then her best friend guy pregnant and our relationship changed and  I basically wouldn't relent and we had to get a divorce  I don't know what I would have had to it would have would have had children with her but I  I wasn't very flexible in the process  what to be flexible  sometimes I am sometimes or no  I've been pulled my boy my father out of off of life support  what made you decide to do that I just keep going back to something he said to me when I was younger that he would come back and haunt me and if I do know if I let him Lay It lay there and suffer  took me a while to convince my other two brothers but that's what we do  can I get erased from my memory  being locked up for a while like erase it from my memory  it's an everyday hell where there's very little Humanity  and you got to do some things that you're not proud of  how easy is it  I've never slept I'm never slept a lot and I'm one of those people that if I wake up I have a hard time going back to sleep so it's best if I'm really tired than you know  what are you  I'm pretty much so with the same oil change  socialite  things are good with the kids and the grandkids except for the live incident with my granddaughter Midol youngest daughter but I had a friend recently who was runned over in a crosswalk and then he's on he's on life support Simon feeling too good about that it's it's affected me  was like he was jaywalking and he literally was walking in the crosswalk and the guy never even hit the brakes o  and he's on that life support at this point  have you noticed any changes in your behavior or soccer  no not really because that's the thing about me is I'm very inconsistent  no  no  but I've had moments when I thought I was I was depressed okay I was talk to you when you were talking to any other question  yesterday  had a conversation with my 14 year old granddaughter  I'm happy I have moments of Happiness everyday cuz I either speak to text with my daughters and granddaughters everything even if we're upset with one another  I have a lot of regrets  can you give me an  I should have went to law school  that's that's kind of something I thought you were going to think about more in my lifetime it was accepted I just didn't I had other other things I thought I wanted to do  I played with those wanting to be a kicker for football on the football team and had some tryouts things like that but didn't pan out  and that is as that didn't pan out I sort of lost my zest for wanting to be a lawyer  we just did other things  I'll take a big that was different I probably would listen to myself  by myself  I could be  if I don't like you I can be very very difficult if I don't like you  I'd very much like to change that  it has in the past year  well I just threw that you can make me feel bad about myself only if I let you and I'm not real big on letting people do that to me on my first wife when when she left me with the children she you know that it was my fault  and I wasn't sure that I believe that but I knew I was an ass and and so I probably believed it and not in its totality but in part  I'm very I'm not judgemental I will listen to anybody but that I agree with you or disagree with you  I've taught myself to  control anger that I that I have  and if if I call you my friend or if I tell you I love you and I mean it that's that's not something that I do  casually  okay why I play 18 holes of golf with it with an old dear friend we got caught up and  4 hours on the golf course 2 hours at dinner  that is your wife have a good time  a lot a lot of memories came in  why am I not like my grandkids I like that you know I like the hell out of them  I don't have all kids in like that I think they're like too much on that rely too much on technology but  but that's me mainly cuz I don't  but if my grandkids are any any sampling of it I think they're good think they're pretty good  I raised my girls  basically by myself with the help of my mother  I think that's the thing I'm most proud of  okay nice chatting with you  already  starting to run with the high school  good memory  head back over to the other

313,male,0,7,that shows you that  who started the virtual human and she's going to chat with you for a bit and then she's good when she finishes them to give you the doorbell so you can let me know  Lexi  are you okay  sure  okay I guess not bad not good  so so  Denver Colorado  to pursue job opportunities  about 2 years ago  once or twice a year  I really like the sunshine all the opportunities all the different kinds of people lots of stuff to do  that sort of thing  I hate the traffic  I wish the seasons were more distinct and everything cost a lot of money here  pretty easy  say  people are rude  not having enough money  what else  just a lot of things are frustrating I guess  I guess it depends on what I'm annoyed about like that another person or about something I did or just life in general  if somebody like a person and always me I'll probably let them know they're annoying me until they stop  that what you're talking about  so so not not as good as I'd like to be  a few days ago about getting paid for something I did on time  pretty pissed off taken advantage of  I like to go to the gym  hang out with friends read right sort of thing  at times  because sometimes I like to keep to myself and don't feel like showing what about word emotion  I have a degree in in Liberal Arts major in political science  I work in sales  209  several of my own businesses and and have lots of money coming in from different streams  guess that's a job  I used to live in Mexico City that was pretty memorable  how much is pretty different than anything I've ever experienced a lot of fun supposed to lot of new things and new people is pretty young and carefree Good Times  not recently but I have in my life traveled quite a bit  Marseille  I went to London has lot of fun pretty cool City little too expensive but definitely cool  of what does anything in life  what's good question  moving tellabs pretty memorable took me a lot of hard work to move here so that was memorable I would say  maybe like  6 months ago  things are just going really well  didn't have much stress in my life  I'm easier more easily irritated and  yell more tired more  kind of down feeling down more  not as productive  yeah while ago  don't exactly it's been a few years but I still feel the same as I did when they diagnosed me so I assume I still depressed  well I just said I'm a big believer in talking to people about your problems so I just thought  that would  be a good idea so I did and that's what I found out  oh yeah definitely  I mean it depends on what you mean by therapy like I are most people probably can't afford therapy but just even talking to friends I would consider therapy somebody who listen so helps you get stuff off your chest  thanks  well I haven't necessarily seen a therapist per se but when you talk to somebody who listens and you and you get stuff  like out there like out of your head or whatever it's it's it helps to destress I think  pretty girls  I'm a good leader I'm really smart  being able to  survive on my own in a city like this completely on my own with no outside help  yeah that stuff  just dumb mistakes I made when I was younger that  Looking Back Now with what I know now I probably would not have made  I would tell myself to seek out and listen to people older than me as much as possible  he's always good for a  sort of pep talk but with a dose of reality doesn't sugarcoat anything so talking to him always helps give me perspective  talented  and I don't know good at stuff and get it a lot of stuff people seem to notice that I I guess nice could this position funny  okay  simulator  all right  are you like controlling a person in the back or today
447,male,0,1,<sync> yeah that's perfectly fine i'm feeling great uh it's an early morning i don't have school i'm excited <laughter> uh born and raised in los angeles california mhm uh the fact that you can surf snowboard and like do two drastically different things in one day uh coming from the neighborhoods i've lived in uh <tisk> i'd say the population of uh lower socio economic backgrounds it it's like a cesspool almost for young african americans and it sucks uh not really i've been to new york connecticut mexico and texas but pretty young hmm <laughter> uh mostly if i'm traveling by plane just the sight and the air is amazing it's remarkable uh the first time i went to new york i was about eleven years old and i made sure i got the the window seat on the plane and just the feeling of taking off is just exhilarating but uh we left um <tisk> at night here in l_a and it was the next day in new york so it was kind of confusing getting used to the time change the first thing i remember doing was uh getting a slice of new york pizza it was it was delicious <laughter> yep <laughter> scrubbed_entry graduating with a bachelor's degree in communications so i can go into the military as an officer actually it's like what i don't know it's like you gotta have a plan and that's the only thing that's just fallen into place and it seems like it's going to fall into place for me hmm to be honest a job that doesn't exist <laughter> it's however you can get paid to do nothing <laughter> yeah but uh probably i was just definitely shy as a kid but i've grown into myself through the experience of college so i'm way more outspoken uh i write music and i work out mostly so if i'm feeling stressed out i just do a set of push ups and lift some weights i'm pretty good um i saw a therapist when i was a kid for about a year and uh i don't know it it taught me to just be able to control my emotions and i don't think i do it in the best way because when i'm angry i do decide to like just bottle the my emotions in instead of letting them out in their appropriate outlets uh not really it's been more of uh an interpersonal thing that's i don't i don't know probably yesterday something in regards to sports the playoffs are on so things like that of that nature um <sigh> hm <sigh> so many um i guess in my senior year of high school i waited to the last minute to apply for the u_c schools and it was unsuccessful because i didn't get to turn in the applications and i'm pretty sure i would've been admitted so it sucks but hey that is an intriguing question <sigh> um i've actually no clue the death of my grandmother sure um my grandmother died when i was eleven years old she raised me from the time i was born because my mother was unable to take care of me she raised my sister my brother and my cousin as well and her five children so she was the matriarch of our family and <sigh> the closest thing i've had to a mother and it was it was tough but um it's gonna be seven years this may next on the thirtieth and uh i've grown quite a bit no more tears uh i'm a foster kid so i was emancipated from the foster program uh about two years ago now but um my immediate family i'm pretty close with them and i see them as much as i can and uh my foster family they're awesome i've known them since i was five so it's been pretty cool fairly easy i fall asleep pretty quick it's not a problem except for when my back's hurting you know then it's a problem mm <tisk> a little moody in the morning i guess i drive more aggressively <laughter> uh a little stressed about a few problems that i can take care of but i shouldn't stress because i either can do something about it or i can't and that's just the way things work uh sure um hm hm uh i have uh a few parking ticket not parking tickets they're not moving violations but they're tickets and i was unaware of if you miss court without being in the hospital or being in jail that you couldn't be excused from not making <ma> making your court date so i had three failure to appears in court which sucked tickets that are thousands of dollars and i have no money so i don't know it's it's pretty tough to deal with when you're trying to make something out of your life but there're so many barriers and obstacles that like you have you didn't forsee so i don't know it gets stressful at times and yeah thinking about it for periods of time some days i just sit and i'm just lost in my thoughts and i don't really communicate to anyone because there's nothing anybody can do for me really so i i just bottle it up like i do everything not very after doing it for so long it becomes a natural thing i i i believe no no hm really happy oh why is that such a difficult question uh mm i don't know i'm pretty content with everything right now i don't know about extreme happiness every day is just the same day seems like uh dunking across the street at the clippers center there's a basketball court there and uh i've been working on it for a while and i finally got up <laugher> yeah mm i have four close friends that i've known for over uh eight years uh each and i don't know studious hardworking determined mm i don't know <laughter> yeah <laughter> mm probably my metabolism which i don't really have control over is uh i don't know i'm pretty content with myself hmm <sigh> i think in uh my sixth grade year of uh uh grade school i was uh i wasn't the best of students but i had a teacher who was diligent and like he failed me through the whole year but i i learned a lot and uh i developed a passion for school afterwards so it was like a situation i overcome after feeling so bad and down uh the same teacher who made me feel really bad actually because if it wasn't for his like sterness i don't think i would've getting the discipline to be where i am at now in college and stuff so he's been pretty influential uh i remember this time i was in the desert or uh uh up in joshua tree with my best friend and his dad and we actually got stuck in the mountains and like we went down a gully and then his jeep wouldn't get over a rock so it was it was pretty yeah it was it was um <tisk> it was kinda weird i i thought i was superman i tried to move a rock that was thousands of pounds didn't work but yeah we eventually got out we thought we were gonna be stuck in the desert but it was a fun time i got to drive in the desert when i didn't have my license so it was fun yeah about that day or in general mm other than like the u_c thing like where i didn't apply to the schools in time i regret that yeah hm i don't know i was i was ten years old ten years ago <laughter> uh i'd probably say to myself uh <sigh> i i have no clue that's that's an interesting question uh being the first from my immediate college <coll> uh immediate family as in my mother my brothers and my sister to go to college so yes it's it's pretty in yeah no problem
350,female,1,11,yes  i'm doing fine thank you  originally i'm from well i was born in mississippi so i'm from gulfport mississippi  yes  i didn't have a choice i was a child i moved here with my parents  <laughter> uh when i was two years old  <laughter> yes i was i was a toddler  yes i like to travel and i travel a lot  um being around new environments and new people uh different things  <cough> um well one of my favorite trips was visiting africa in i think two thousand six i visited uh west africa and that was a great trip for me it was a medical mission where we volunteered and gave medical assistance to people  a friend of mine uh was actually involved and she talked to me about getting involved so i went in with her and it went from there so i don't know i made the decision that way   i am i am happy i did that it's something i'll never forget <laughter>  i studied english and education so that i could teach high school students  uh not currently no well right now i um tutor privately for a private tutoring company and looking to get back into the classroom working as a teacher  mhm wow anything that uh combines teaching traveling and writing would be a dream job for me so yeah anything that combines those three items so teaching has the closest outcome to that    um  occasionally yes <laughter> um <clears throat>  i don't know i guess in comparison to others that are considered outgoing um and and a lot of people have said i seem reserved or kinda introverted i don't know   mm well  i don't know i read um i just started meditation  mm try to breathe and calm down <laughter> yeah  some things that make me really mad um  mistreatment of children  abuse of children  um try to figure out what's annoying me usually and then go from there uh if i can control not being annoyed like ultimately i control that whether or not i'm annoyed so try to figure out what the problem is and then go from there and not be annoyed <laughter> if i can help it all  oh i'm fine i can totally <to> in at controlling my temper i think so i don't have a yeah    the last time i argued with someone  was um  i don't know maybe a couple of days ago and it was about um it was about um a smell they had on their clothes but i thought smelled like perfume and they said it did not so <laughter>  yeah  <laughter> this is cool uh i think i'm very close to my family we're a pretty close knit family talk every day um see each other almost every day  there've been a lot of positive um influences in my life i would say my aunt and uh definitely my mother have all been positive influences  well um i look i look <l> i uh <clears throat> look up to my aunt um i think she's positive i look up to her  because obviously we grew up with very similar backgrounds came from very similar neighborhoods and areas and she's very successful um despite the types of things that we've gone through as children  and um she doesn't let her past define her future uh my mom's overcome so many obstacles as well um she had some challenges with her health but she still tries to be optimistic and she's still tries to   you know overcome these things and just still live our life despite some physical barriers that she might have so i look up to people who are able to  you know not allow their current situation to dictate their future because anything is possible   no i have not  no i have  um well i was diagnosed um within the last um year and uh then again most recently within the last three months  well um fear and just not knowing what to do with uh some of the things i was feeling and not knowing um you know why i couldn't stop feeling the way i was feeling  there were a lot of symptoms um  um you know mostly i uh i gained a lot of weight um i couldn't sleep a lot and then sometimes i could sleep too much <laughter> um  felt sad sometimes  like i wanted to cry a lot  i've been feeling okay um there are days yeah um i don't know every day is different so i mean today i feel fine but like i said everything is differently lately i've been feeling um more like i can be involved <inv> involved in my own life and like i wanna get   out and do more things  um  no no it's no no i haven't  not any different from before what i was experiencing before  no  mm well mm i was receiving um  uh i guess psychotherapy and um i don't know a lot of things happened i moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother and i just kinda  got more involved in taking care of other people instead of myself for a while  uh sometimes  i do  yes it is it's kinda difficult um i either have a hard time falling asleep or a hard time staying asleep i'm sure it is i just don't know what it is as of yet because i you know <sniffle> usually it's um thoughts continual thoughts running through my mind that either keep me up or make it hard for me to uh go asleep or make it hard for me to stay asleep mhm um journal sometimes uh that might help if i can write some things down and get it out that helps other than that i don't you know i haven't found any really great ways of coping  it tired <laughter>  yeah mostly uh tired um kinda confused  i don't know for the most part i feel happy it's just um   last time i felt really happy was i guess over the holidays  uh i don't know i guess the just being around uh family and friends just the holiday season i guess in general that's just a happy time for me and seeing people i haven't seen in a while um that's about it  how would my best friend describe me probably as um  quiet sometimes cautious talkative sometimes um tenacious  um i don't know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for uh some of my accomplishments and they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because i'm caring and compassionate or um easy to talk to um that i remind them of a of <o> feel like a sister to them  <laughter>  um everyone has regrets i'm sure yeah i regret stuff  to just  relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and i don't mean to sound that way but it's true it's just um you have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you um to not compare yourself to other people because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their  their time and their progression to how they get to things so i would tell me ten years ago to just believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that i want for my life and don't be  yeah  um really enjoyed working with um well  okay a science project <laughter> with um my younger uh relatives my cousins we did a science project together and it was fun despite the mess we made it was a ball um being the first to attend college in my family and then um going to college and coming back to the community where i uh went to school and then teaching in that community and volunteering in that community and helping um youth or children that come from the same background that i came from so  uh i'm most proud of being able to  have the opportunity to improve and better myself and then to come back and help someone else improve and better themself as well   goodbye

doing something i said i would do if i'm at home and if i'm too far away from home to do it then i don't have anything to worry about <laughter> um recently i went to honduras again that's where my family's from so it was sort of like a it's it's a dual fold i get to see my family but i also kinda get to be away from home so i do it by not imposing on them i visit them but i stay in a hotel so that way i can still kinda have my freedom and not feel like i'm obligated to being with them so it's more fun that way experiences on vacation or um most memorable experience probably hawaii in lahaina and just having i love food i'm a foodie so having the pig roasted underground and just eating it that way it just i've never been able to taste it that way any time else so it's like a very memory it's a deep memory for me 'cause no matter what i do to my pork it'll never taste like that pork in lahaina <laughter> business and that was years ago so i ended up in the marketing field so i've enjoyed i my business background did help me in the marketing field my dream job hmm well i guess it would have to do with food i love to cook and the only reason i hesitate is because i love to cook but i just do it for home and friends and family if it were to turn into in if it were to turn into a job i feel as if it would just not be as joyous or i wouldn't have as much fun as i do have it you know as i have now but if i could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that i have in cooking every day now then that would be my dream job i'm outgoing <laughter> <laughter> that's cool <laughter> uh depends on where i'm at if i'm wherever i'm at actually the first thing i do is just kinda get a hold of myself that way i'm always in control no matter where i'm standing at and always say that i am my own peace p a p e a c e so i just kinda just take a deep breath assess my situation figure out what i can control what i can't control and then proceed from there but just sort of just kinda <deep breath> <sigh> breathe and get a hold of myself first i'm actually very good i'm actually very mild-tempered to begin with um i don't really let anything agitate me and so if i do feel myself just getting hot or if i just react i just sort of just like i said i just do my own little self check you know eh i might've cussed i might've went off for a second but i do my own little self check and just say you know what come on no this is mm it's not worth it this person's not worth it the situation is not worth it be who you are and just stay there actually it was with my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and i was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kinda overlooking my feelings in it and i was i didn't want him to overlook my feelings and act as if i wasn't feeling the way i was feeling so i kept stressing my point in different ways and then i found myself now in a debate and then that's when i pulled back and said no look babe this is how i feel about it i'm not asking you to make me feel any differently i'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings when i got to my own conclusion i felt triumphant because the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how i felt not for him to impose his you know he's very a macho kinda manly guy i didn't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic and so i said no as long as i i felt better because i he i felt undestood and i felt heard hmm <sigh> let's see i can my son comes to mind he's twenty two years old and he we have a very estranged relationship right now and it's okay i'm okay with it he's used to be being a little bit more needy so he i think he assumed that i would just always look xxx go looking for him or call for him as opposed to waiting him to call me and i think it may be a very weird answer but i wish early on in my life as his mother i would've kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come and check on him he doesn't live with me he has his own place but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know try to make sure that he's okay i think this is probably way more <laughter> ethereal than you meant but i would've i would've done that differently i would've mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that i would've treated him more of an adult and then also not expected him to just kinda you know i would've killed the expectation in him for me to contour to him if that makes sense woo <laughter> no it's not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kid's needs ahead of your own and i guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay you're okay so it my my son my daughter they both know i love them unconditionally so my parenting has become easier the more and more i've lived in that truth where i'm not expecting anything from them but then also not expecting any disrespect so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect seeing them maybe make decisions that i wish they wouldn't make uh it could be as simple as an outfit <laughter> you know choice or as much as a career change but um having to sit back watch them listen be open and then just kinda just be there you know if they wanna talk about it but then not also also trying not to manage them because i was also their age and i have to remember that i i didn't wanna be managed and even if i made a mistake i didn't wanna be judged so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on their own and just sort of kinda just waiting around and luckily it's nothing major with my kids but whatever that personal downfall is just kinda being there and not having an i told you i told you so um spirit on me it's fulfilling knowing that you know i created this you know i planned both my kids so it's just it's a real it's an honor that i was able to do it it's an honor that they're healthy um and it's fun watching them sort of just kind of grow into their own and it's like they're mini me's but then they're also different than i am and so it's fun just being able to allow them uh be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so i'm enjoying that wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the sixties um i was born the year after they got here so their their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle eh which was not a bad thing it's just that their parenting style was more about um making sure we had a home making sure uh we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter so i had to kinda figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent divorcing my first husband um 'cause i was gonna be the one that toppled that whole situation um he was a good father just not a good husband to me and after twenty years i knew that i was gonna be the one to say this is not working for me anymore and since i did that the domino effect has <ha> was is this is not virtual it happened <laughter> we ended up selling our house you know dividing up the assets and then living separately and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while um and then i just made some decisions to where i didn't wanna go through so much court hassle so i just did a tina turner and said just give me my name you keep everything else so it was just a very hard decision by way of how it affected my kids that's all i cared about in terms of losing everything physical and and all the material stuff i could care less but it was hard because i i knew it was gonna affect my kids and they were the only thing i was concerned about uh my husband and i did not you know see eye to eye on certain things xxx regarding our marriage he i didn't feel validated as a woman or as a wife and that's just who i am and those were the very areas that he didn't validate me in he just kinda saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extracurriculars whether it was just travel or or whatever the case may be i'm not i'm not here to talk about that part of it bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home and i was tired of just you know working and and and him benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he wasn't prepared to change xxx despite all the counseling we went through and i thought well this is not working for me and i have to take care of myself first and i i had low self-esteem i you know i wasn't perfect i had a lot of things going on with myself and i had to learn how to love myself in order to uh in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the love that i should get in return <laughter> you know what it's actually pretty easy because at the end of the day i just you know good bad ugly or indifferent whatever mistakes i made that day or whatever great thing went on that day my goal in life is just to have peace of mind so when i put my head down at night i i just i ask myself did you know did i do anything that i'm ashamed of today did i cross anybody did i not do you know and i'm not being sanctimonious or acting as if i'm pollyanna but i believe in karma i'm a god-fearing woman so i just wanna make sure that i did everything i was supposed to do today and if there's something that i can rectify you know i just make it a point to promise to myself to go back and rectify it or at least learn from that and just not make that same mistake in another day really good light um you know had some rough patches with the family individually like i said with my son my daughter's a teenager so she's kinda coming into her own so that's a different relationship she's opposite of me i'm i'm actually very easygoing very bohemian style she's very social very you know just out there so i'm having to just kinda find our balance but overall it's just i i won't complain i'm very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle that i just kinda foster on my own every day and i just enjoy my little mini accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not <laughter> no i haven't thank god no really happy let's see uh it's at home and i think it was when wow <mumbling> different things running through my head um i think when my daughter and i my teenage daughter and i came to understanding <underst> eh understanding on our mother daughter relationship i'm not trying to be her best friend but yet that doesn't mean she can't talk to me and i think when she came to me the other day and just kinda gave me a big hug from behind me without really saying anything i really felt her just accepting herself and she accepted the fact that i accept who she is as she is so it was a very tame moment only she and i kinda knew about it but it just it gave just a happiness that nothing else could ever give me <laughter> thank you um <laughter> i'm easygoing i'm fun i'm just very you know um eh chameleon comes to mind i just kinda acclimate to what whatever situation i'm in i'm very honest i'm very real and just you know bold if i have to be um i'm just very adult i'm an adult woman and you know they would just decribe <descr> or my best friend would describe me as someone that she can rely on extremely reliable i do as i say i say what i do and i just you know i don't i don't deal with b s <laughter> hmm what could i change about myself uh probably cosmetic things maybe i would just uh that's not even true let me think what what what are some things i would change about myself um sounds weird that i would say not much <m> nothing really um i think i would just be a little bit more aware of others i think i'm a i'm super sensitive to others but i think i would just be more aware make sure that i'm not being selfish or i'm not tuning anyone out just because i wanna get through my yoga or i wanna do something else i think i would just be more um observant and aware of those around me to make sure i'm not offending anybody i don't have any regrets i i think about that all the time and you know it's it's natural to go back and say if i were in that situation with the mindset i have now what would i do eh but the reality is that i know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me so i can't you know very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret because i know i learned from it um probably sounds very textbook but that's true that's just really how i live so i believe that everything good bad ugly or indifferent happened for a reason i truly believe that and my job is to take from it what i'm supposed to take from it and take that into my future so i'm to take the you know the hard knocks with the with the joys hmm be real with myself that's that's one thing that took me twenty years to kinda get to um just to kinda be honest with myself to embrace who i am to just you know get to know who i am uh learn my own infrastructure be comfortable with the uh with the innate things that are a part of me don't try to revamp <re> don't try to revamp myself or try to become something that i'm not uh i would've still chosen the same marketing career to still i would've still climbed the same corporate ladders but i would've done it from a more internal place um not that i lost myself in it but when in terms of my family life i would've just been more true to myself and that way i wouldn't have had any kind of resentments my family my uh my role as a wife my role as a mother i think that ultimately that's where my main fulfillment comes from because no matter what at the end of this life's this life uh this body uh in this leased vehicle that i'm in um all i'm gonna do or all i'm gonna be is an epitaph <laughter> somewhere in a cementary scrubbed_entry and i'm always just true to that i mean i i've been always true to that from the time i was eighteen and realized i wanted to be married and have a family and kids and all that i think that ultimately that that's where my true fulfillment comes from <laughter> cool thank you bye

my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer  you travel a lot yes  experiencing different things in different cultures  well I was stationed in Germany for three years it was a great experience  food was great averion Alps the snow the people I loved it  having a baby  well it was this the most memorable thing in my life something I never forget  great  once I'm grown handsome father-of-two  no it's actually very hard for me  not becoming angry too quickly  being able to cultivate a mind and love someone unconditionally  well I went through a lot of trauma as a child so as a parent I was very afraid for my child to go to that thing, try to protect him from it  I think it's really hard because you never really know people and what they'll do  outgoing  because if I'm in a room with people I'm usually  the first one to start talking  doesn't matter fact I have fish aquarium that's what keeps me calm  not very good  seems like everyday argue with somebody about something but yesterday  I'm a lady tried to cut line in the grocery store and I politely told her I was in line and she didn't want to move  yes it have because sometimes if people don't want to move then I feel it's my place to move them  hurting people physically  if I feel disrespected or somebody puts their hands on me I can get very ugly I don't like that about  I was pulled over by the police and they had someone with my name and they were very rude to me and I really wasn't happy with the way they treated me  how to stay calm when someone has  crossed over into my boundary  my personal space  I can't let people get too close to me if they do I eyelash out I don't want anybody in my area of  protection I guess  stay away from people  stay away from him it's hard you can't live in this world

I want to go into it  18  very young  no  because I was assaulted in and I have a fear of  people in uniform like policemen hurting me or other military veterans hurting me when they  explode or go off or have issues of  PTSD  I can't remember  what did you do after the military  I work for the federal government  well just seemed like a normal progression the federal government gives you 10 point preference over other people for being in the military still being like a Natural Choice organization that had a book of rules and they follow them the government what government to another  are you happy  yes  well it was hard in the sense that in the military you're giving you told to handle it handle it and in the civilian world you have to go through so many hoops and different people to talk to to get something done  administration of justice  no I'm I don't work anymore  oh yeah  almost 2 years  the feeling that I was always going to be hurt that someone was out to get me I had nightmares panic attacks anxiety attacks out  outbursts of anger  I was always an emotional pain  and I always wanted to hit somebody  yes mostly disrespect what I feel is disrespect of people getting too close to me or I feel in fear of them for some reason  I can't remember the last time I had a good night sleep  what  irritable angry Moody pissed off  irrational  tired  sick of the world angry at the world  wanting to be left alone  sometimes I don't want to go on  yes  oh yeah oh yeah  well I I could recognize the trigger now when something is going to trigger me I can at least  no and act accordingly if I want to  when I found my grandchildren when they came to visit  I just so innocent and sweet and precious it was just a joy to have them around 8 make me forget about all the pain in

430,male,0,3,<synch> yeah sure i'm fine thank you i am from los angeles well you can't beat the weather um and i just think the familiarity of home just uh makes me feel comfortable here smog uh rudeness although it doesn't compare to new york it's um <laughter> people can be unbearable when they're rude um not as much as i'd like lately i traveled more in the past but uh not lately no i just think seeing different places it's um learning new things uh finding things that are fascinating that peak my interest um let's see i think <laughter> spoke of new york earlier i think the first time i went to new york i was quite amazed i know it's uh still <st> still only in america but i just think um being from l_a i didn't think anything or any city could be bigger and more uh how do you say uh ostentatious than new york but uh it was it was quite an experience and uh i didn't think any place was uh i didn't <di> i didn't think any place was dirtier than downtown l_a <laughter> but i think times <time> i think <laughter> times square's got us beat too many to mention i i don't even know where to start suppose it depends on the situation um i like to walk i like to uh i like to play with my dogs uh reading uh anything where i guess i suppose i could just sit still let and let my mind go blank i know reading requires some concentration but uh you know just uh things that uh i don't have to um exert myself too much uh helps me relax <sigh> in the past i've had problems but i'm getting better <laughter> let's just say that <laughter> ah probably argued with my roommate <psh> couple days ago but uh that happens we're friends uh it's a loving argument <laughter> if if you will uh i met this roommate about six seven years ago we just uh kind of um kinda moved around the same social circles and just got along it's cool i mean guess you know like we do argue uh we have our differences sometimes but there's not one person i'd rather have i'd rather live with than than her she's she's cool hmm how much time do we have uh <laughter> it's just too numerous to mention um i i i wouldn't know how to answer that i think breaking up with a girlfriend that i truly cared about but knowing knowing that it just wasn't going to work um that was very difficult just weighed pros and cons and just thought it just wasn't going to work um no matter how much love or care i brought to the relationship there was something missing and i think i invested enough time she invested enough time and just knew it was over no so many <laughter> i don't have too many regrets but things you erase from your memory oh there's a lot uh too numerous to mention i don't know how to answer that the same girl that i broke up with she was the she was a girlfriend <laughter> of uh a a best friend of mine uh they were separated for for several years and we always had a chemistry always a friendship and it turned into something to something which you know turned into a relationship and uh it hurt him uh and currently we do not speak i wish uh my regret is i wish i i would've handled that better <scoff> um it's it's funny see as i as i get older i'm not as close but i still care for 'em and i still love them and i think they love me i my mother and my father are both alive mm don't interact a whole lot i'm very close to my older sister my older sister um she's just strong no nonsense uh she's short yet a firecracker and i've always liked that about her she uh uh she always felt makes me feel makes me feel comfortable i'm like uh another son to her <laughter> in a way uh suppose it depends on my stress level um when i have a lot on my mind i have difficult sleeping and uh other times it just if i really need to get to sleep it just requires me listen to the radio listen <lis> uh watching t_v reading and eventually i'll get tired fall asleep crabby uh i suppose like anybody else um tired listless you know all the normal things i suppose happen when somebody doesn't sleep well i feel good mm no not really um no no i i wouldn't say i have no i have not yes i have i was diagnosed probably about about five years ago i think uh i always knew there was a problem i always knew there was some i i i think i always knew before i got treatment that there was some issue emotionally and hmm and lot of things that are very hard to explain and i just was tired of feeling that way so i sought help think just uh lethargy uh uh no desire to do anything uh motivation just was wasn't there um think normal depression type things uh um social <socia> i became socially awkward which was a little bit different for me 'cause uh growing up i was you know quite talkative <laughter> i do i'm sorry say again gotcha um it does i think it does well um <sigh> i think the number one thing and this is what i'm amazed about is the temper i think i've uh it's allowed me to to step back from certain situations and not take them so seriously and not get so tense or angry and then react i think it's it it's calmed me down for the most part now it's becoming it it it's becoming routine uh initially it was very difficult when i was five years old <laughter> oh no when <wh> when you're a kid there's nothing really to um there's nothing to be sad about you're a kid my best friend um a jerk i don't yeah uh i have a dry i have a dry sense of humor so uh you know my best friend would probably uh i think the the banter back and forth is you know usually an insult but you know it's all in love um i wish i could be taller i wish i could be more inclined to play basketball so i then become go to the n_b_a and be a millionaire i know that's all unrealistic but just answering honestly hmm anything i regret haven't we asked asked this before i mean so many don't know where to start mm that's a good one wow um wow i don't know i you know that's a good one i'd have <ha> i'd have to think about that i don't i wouldn't wanna answer that uh that's a good one usually you're asked um what you'd what you know how you feel ten twenty years from now looking back i don't know what advice i'd give myself something i really enjoyed um hmm i love um there are several things i like to do um uh you know i uh i enjoy playing basketball i i i love watching it i love watching all sports for that matter what brings me real joy the past few years was um become a hobby of mine is is uh rescuing dogs fostering dogs and finding them them homes uh it's <laughter> i guess it's become quite a a hobby of mine and uh sometimes i find lost dogs and i'm able to find their owner and sometimes i'm not so when i'll tell you what there's nothing <noth> to find the owner and i just found an owner last week for a small dog i found eh there is not greater feeling 'cause the man told me <laughter> the man told me how his um how his <hi> how his daughter or was just crying when she left so to be able to give her give him back that was that was cool i think for somebody that um didn't finish high school going on to college and graduating that's something that i uh i take pride in though i don't show it or speak about it often <laughter> yeah you look you look like my friend rachel it's funny <laughter>
478,female,0,1,<synch> yes uh good thanks the east coast for work uh rarely i prefer it out here uh i it's um not as nice as the lifestyle out here i like the weather better and uh just a lot of things about living here it's my favorite city so uh somewhat um but i mostly what's that um just um i like to go to france a lot i like the food there and um just the uh lifestyle the shopping that sort of thing uh art history and marketing uh well um i became interested in high school and i thought it was a good um classical education uh and um i interned at andy warhol's magazine when i was in high school and so that scrubbed_entry hmm yes yes uh eh i'm pretty happy with what i'm i'm doing i do um consulting so i write marketing plans that sort of thing um it's can be fairly hard about writing a marketing plan um uh i don't know it's hard it's hard to um <laughter> to talk to someone who's about it who's not in marketing it it requires just um a knowledge of uh you know how it's how it how it's done and it it takes uh several months to to do one so um well i guess i'm i originally kind of shy but um i i become more outgoing just 'cause of work and stuff um i like to exercise uh i i do um hiking with my dogs we walk up up and down a hill a couple times is it good uh i don't remember um i don't know nothing comes to mind mm um sometimes i don't i don't clean my car it might get lots of dog hair in it and i feel bad when i i should always stay on top of that just getting to the car wash and stuff uh well i had a conflict with my brother and so um i had to decide to have an estrangement from him and that makes the most sense and that was a a somewhat difficult decision but just because of his angry behavior it wasn't it wasn't that difficult but um you know it was <wa> it was somewhat difficult because i i loved him very much so um i'm not close to my family so um but i don't really have one um i have a a japanese friend uh oh i think the sensor came off i have a a japanese friend i'm i'm uh very close with she's like my kind of a my <m> my mother and um scrubbed_entry uh i just met them socially um scrubbed_entry uh i don't know nothing comes to mind <talking to experimenter> <talking to experimenter> <talking to experimenter> <talking to experimenter> <talking to experimenter> <talking to experimenter> um pretty easy 'cause i keep a regular schedule um just <jus> just kind of tired maybe a little bit irritable uh good um well i'm recovering from p_t_s_d so um i sometimes feel the the p_t_s_d and then i'll i'll take a medication for that no it's just uh it's just left over of the i'm still <sti> i still have the stress from it i'm still being treated for it it i don't really have any um i prefer not to talk about it um in the past but it's treated um five years ago uh i was i was just um very sad very depressed and so um i also had anxiety so i i went to to doctor and um they helped me and i did uh psychotherapy yeah for the p_t_s_d though um i don't know i guess uh it's just um just kind of supportive because <be> because of the issues i have with my family it's it's supportive to have a doctor who is supportive and um you know it just uh gives me good feedback and helps me to make good decisions that sort of thing i yeah i have nightmares about my family sometimes yeah thanks oh uh i i just try to uh sleep better i xxx i xxx i xxx before i go to sleep i sort of like um meditate a little bit to get to be calm and then hope that that will help i feel happy all the time pretty much like i my dogs make me happy and you know my life is really happy so mhm uh i guess you know as a a nice person i'm thoughtful um a good friend um <sigh> and happy fun person um i don't know i mean i'm in my forties now so i'm pretty happy with with myself my <m> you know my um you know uh i've i've done a lot of a lot of work on myself in in therapy and stuff so i'm pretty i wouldn't really change a lot i'm pretty happy with myself i mean not to sound conceited but i'm i'm pretty um happy with myself now uh well <we> that would that would be um my parents they're very abusive so i don't <d> i <d> i don't talk to them anymore so <laughter> um any you know any times with them you know they they uh you know said <sai> did terrible things to me so i prefer not to talk about it uh let's see um well i just started reading a book i i like to read um cookbooks and i was just reading a book called um when french women cook and it's about uh a woman's relationship with different women and friends in different parts of france and the and the cooking and so i'm really enjoying that book mhm um i usually you know um get the grocery shopping done which i enjoy i really i really like doing the grocery shopping i go to a few places and and do a bit of cleaning and um uh just uh relax oh yeah i would <wou> i would say um to have better self-esteem 'cause i used to have very low self-esteem you know from being abused and so um you know i i wish i'd been happier <ha> happier in the past and you know it's taken me a long time to become happy because um you know no matter what what i did whatever achievements i i was i was never happy in the past i was i was always you know struggling with being depressed i didn't <di> i didn't even know why and now you know i realize because of whatever events that it that it was from my parents from that um a relationship and so i my i what the advice would be to not um have a relationship that um is bad for you like sometimes estrangement is the best choice in an abusive relationship um just just <j> the way i live my life the way i treat people i think you know um you know i i believe it like your deeds are very important and i try to treat people in a good way and and i guess you know i'm i'm proud of you know with my work like decisions i've made that um that give me um you <y> you know a a a a uh a job that i i like that gives me a lot of flexibility and i you know i do what i like and <sigh> um and you know people like my work and um and also my my dogs i'm really proud of them and um yeah i guess <gu> i don't know <laughter> mhm okay thank you bye
427,female,0,5,<sync> yeah sure i'm good how are you i'm from florida originally mhm where are you from oh um for work <laughter> uh i haven't been back in like a few months um i don't know i guess it's like a smaller town than here it was pretty easy it's um it's not that  much of a difference except i guess the buildings are bigger <laughter> um <tisk> i like the weather and uh i like the environment of like hollywood i guess <laughter> i hate the transportation <transporta> the transportation system and the traffic it's really bad <laughter> mhm yeah i've traveled a lot around america um i like like seeing new places and meeting new people from different areas and stuff and uh i guess it's just relaxing and it's fun <laughter> uh well i went to canada once my mom has a friend up there so we went to visit her there it's pretty cold <laughter> i didn't like that about that particular trip or um i don't know she made us this uh like canadian food called i think it's poutine or something and so i guess that <laughter> that was a  new experience um i try to get out in the sun like go to the beach or something or read a book um pretty okay <laughter> depends on how bad the situation is um i don't know like  two days ago i was arguing with my sister about something oh yeah <laughter> i really don't remember it something stupid i think she i don't know she borrowed something from me and she didn't give it back on time <laughter> um i don't know i guess i mean yeah i wish i just wouldn't lose my temper so quickly sometimes but that doesn't happen really often um i don't know i guess think more before i talk then maybe i won't lose my temper <laughter> um something i wish i could erase from my memory um i don't know i guess just like uh negative people or something negative people that i've met before i guess i just wanna erase the thought of meeting them um well i had like friends that were just like not very good company and they're just very not very good influences so yeah i would just wanna erase meeting them but i'm not friends with them anymore so um my who's a positive influence my family is a positive influence <laughter> and my friends now oh it's pretty good i talk to them a lot i see them a lot so yeah mm the hardest decision i've ever had to make i don't know <laughter> i guess um what i wanted to study in college maybe it's not that hard but <laughter> it's a little it's a big decision computer science thanks yeah a little bit <laughter> not not as much but a little bit well i got into it it when <wh> i got into it when i was a teenager so i guess i just and i was good at it so i just figured i'd go on studying it for higher at a higher level yeah somewhat but i uh kinda wanted to i was kinda trying to make a decision between that and like the arts so yeah i'm just happy i did it though my dream job <laughter> uh fashion designer <laughter> yeah how hard is the job um i don't think it's a hard job <laughter> i like clothes and fabric and making clothes like that so i don't think it's a hard job actually i fall asleep like within five minutes depending on how tired i am i'm very irritable <laughter> and uh yeah i'm very irritable and not good to be around <laughter> when i'm tired and i can't focus i've been feeling good fine thanks no no no um the last time i felt really happy mm i guess like a week or so ago i went to um i went to where did i go i went to this event downtown it was like a art walk thing so it was exciting thanks oh it was just like different art um galleries and stuff downtown they're just exhibiting their work and i don't know it was just interesting to walk around and see all that um i think i'm generous um patient i think i'm a good friend <laughter> um i think i'm hard working and what else yeah i that's that's it i think um i wish i was more outgoing like more sociable person and um what else i don't know and i wish i was like i guess not um not easy to um anger like get a temper or something oh no not in trouble it's just sometimes it's <laughter> it's not pleasant for people um getting <get> getting a having a temper but i've never gotten in trouble or mm really badly no um i can't <laughter> think of um i guess i was in i was in a um <tisk> elevator one time and this person like was running towards it and like like i was trying to hold it for them but i couldn't reach it in time and they like started cursing me out <laughter> so  like i felt really bad 'cause they  probably thought i didn't try to open it for them but yeah it was that <laughter> um anything i regret <clears throat> not really i well yeah i regret um not contacting like old friends that i knew so i guess yeah maybe i'll do that in the future i know them from like elementary school yeah but we lost contact through the years 'cause i switched schools <clears throat> for now i mean oh okay um i don't know i guess i would just say um learn as much as i can and i don't know just don't hold back so much with like um like not being outgoing and stuff i guess i'd just tell myself to be more outgoing <laughter> um i think they'd say the same thing i said earlier that i'm generous patient hard working and what else did i say um kind <laughter> i hope they'd say that <sigh> mm i am proud of my intelligence okay okay bye take care
333,male,0,5,yes very well  new york  just turn the volume up a little bit  <laughter> uh for a change yeah it's good  i wanted <wa> i wanted to i wanted to see what los angeles was about  um probably took a year or two  uh you know being away from my family being away from what i was used to in new york the neighborhoods the people and just getting acclimated to a whole new lifestyle here uh the weather  you can't beat the weather it's generally always nice it's not too hot it's not too cold uh it's creative i do like uh you know movies  uh like the beach  the traffic it's a lot of traffic uh  some of the sometimes i think people are a little bit colder here than and more distant and unfriendly than other places  i was a history major  no uh i do uh demonstrations in really <rea> uh high-end supermarkets uh to be a screenwriter  that's one of the reasons why i came to los angeles  um it's hard 'cause i don't always maintain uh focus and motivation i let other things distract me <laughter>  uh i was uh i've always been interested in films ever since i was a child and i was just always you know was writing and had an active imagination   uh i've in the last probably almost ten years i've traveled more than i had in the past <pa> well i've always traveled even as a kid my parents would travel around so yes seeing new places and seeing uh people that are different than i am seeing how they live  and taking in the sights  uh i went to kenya that was probably one of the best trips i ever went on um on the safari and   just going out in a jeep and seeing <laughter> wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible   oh yeah that's one the great experiences of my life and i also got to uh  a a place in egypt uh at the end of that trip um called uh  sharm el sheikh which is right on the water and it has some of the best scuba diving in the world which is hard to believe that egypt would but it was just amazing i went <we> i didn't go scuba diving i went uh snorkeling  what do i do to relax uh i i do i like to listen to music i like to uh helping watching movies helps me relax 'cause it takes me out of you know whatever might be on my mind i do meditate every day um i like to take walks in nature that's always calming especially down by the uh the ocean  uh what i it depends <laughter> sometimes i get angry and lose my temper uh a lot of times uh  i'll do like a form of self-hypnosis and calm myself which is something i've recently learned how to do  which is very helpful  and also since i meditate it doesn't i don't get annoyed at things as easily as i did in the past some things that makes me really mad  i guess uh think of injustice  in the world or done to people when uh it doesn't really need to be that way that we could all get along  um  and and make the world better <laughter> uh last night i went to a movie screening  of a independent film and i didn't think it was done very well it's not so much that we had a fun argument  about uh about the movie  so that was like you know that just happened yesterday so that was that's on my mind  <laughter> is there anything i regret yeah there's there are have been opportunities in my life that i wished i had uh taken them and pursued them  uh certain jobs you know when i first got to los angeles i had an opportunity to uh  become a grip and uh and i i probably should've pursued that  how did i decide it to do that i don't really understand the questions take advantage of every opportunity that came my way  to always <alway> i think saying yes  uh to any opportunity is is very important and no matter   how you feel you know you have to be confident that you'll be able to achieve what you wanna do  no no no but i've been depressed in my life  uh for the most part i've i've been feeling good sometimes uh i feel a little blue uh i think you know sometimes if i if i allow <allo> allow a regret to come into my mind that can bring me down but i can you know usually get out if it pretty quickly  uh sometimes financial concerns sometimes uh  an an opportunity um how do i explain it eh there  sometimes <so> sometimes <someti> eh financial is one way i that i if i had made another decision i might have more money or my life would be different  um  not really i mean i i feel  pretty much the same what got me to seek help for <laughter> let's come back to that  um i've well okay well it generally talking to someone has helped when i did do that  uh pretty easy i don't have a problem sleeping  uh  usually i'm grumpy <laughter> so if i don't sleep well uh you know i feel tired and irritable   uh  how would my best friend describe me that's a good question um friendly <f> well i'm friendly <f> i'm definitely friendly and outgoing uh little bit secretive um i would probably that i should be they'd like to see me more accomplished and uh and uh attaining my goals and happier <ha> maybe a little happier   i think um  it it it's tough it depends sometimes i'm very introverted 'cause i do like to write so that takes it means that i have to spend time alone and then when i come out of that uh i'm extroverted so i don't really see myself with as one hard way or the other it all depends on my on the situation and my mood  my best qualities um i think i'm caring i think i'm intelligent  uh i think i'm funny i'm outgoing um i have a likeable personality  you know people have said that  um i'm engaging but not uh oppressive or overly engaging there's a sort of a cool detachment  um and creative intuitive  <laughter> yes <laughter>  last time i felt really happy  i don't know i woke up this morning i was pretty happy  i had breakfast i was happy  sun was shining  <laughter>  um  i think that like i said going to kenya  was a memorable experience i do remember <remem> scuba uh snorkeling was a really great experience <ex> experience i just remembered you know seeing all the colors in the ocean  you know and feeling the sun powerful sun on my back  um almost beyond you know because <beca> almost beyond like   human in a way just more in touch with like everything the universe yeah it would be nice to feel that way every moment of the day but  what am i most proud of in my life  i think i've uh helped <pft> people  uh and sometimes when they were in crisis um you know i've written some screenplays <scr> screenplays um  i've had some good relationships  um good relationships just you know being connected with someone else you know  spending time with them and connecting  on emotional and  <laughter> physical and  mental levels  um what it could be a song that i hear on the radio uh it could be uh lot of times looking forward to something you know if i'm gonna go to a movie go bowling hang out with people um you know looking at work and and going to work and feeling productive can put me in it puts me in a good mood you're welcome bye bye
321,female,1,20,okay my arms  chat with you  and then she'll let you know when you guys are done  okay alright then  yeah  I'm okay  I'm Chicago Illinois  at my husband's work was here  + 84  it was not easy for me it took about three years  I'm just a move I moved away from my family so I was uncomfortable I didn't know anyone here and even though I did make friends I just felt out of place  not as often as I would like I used to go back at least once a year but in the last few years that's diminish so I would say like every 3 years  the weather  I love the weather the beach you know as I've been here as long as I have the people have some nice people here  of the people some of the people yeah also I would say the economy  it's very difficult to make it here in Los Angeles  business in computer graphics  I'm not working in it right now  I'm working in retail  I just couldn't find work and so I had to settle for doing that for right now  it's very tough  I would like to be a human resource representative  no  I like to talk to people too much and when I understand right I know a lot about a subject I can go on and on about it and I'm interested in finding out about people if I'm sitting next to somebody else strike up a conversation with them just to find out who they are and  just so you know I'd like to talk to people I enjoy it  I'm quiet  rude people people that harm children in the elderly that makes me very angry War  I control my temper I don't have a problem with that I just get quiet when I feel angry and I try to think before I act  the last time we argued with someone was about a month ago and it was with my daughter and I was arguing with her over her therapy and she has cancer and dumb she wasn't telling me enough she wasn't giving me enough information and so that made me very angry I was frustrated and angry  yeah it was very hard  no  watching your children fail when they're trying hard or seeing that they can hurt themselves and trying to prepare them for that when they won't listen to your advice. I feel like sometimes they need to trust me more  the love of my children  when I was stop playing with my granddaughter and there was about a month ago  very excited and happy and just all my cares were gone I wasn't thinking about anything except for having fun with her so it was a good time  yeah it's the best  no  yes  it was over 5 years ago  I couldn't function I couldn't drive I couldn't sleep I couldn't eat at my I couldn't do anything I was completely  shut down I felt like I felt like I was looking out a window and in life was going on outside that window and I was just stuck behind the glass III couldn't participate  I knew something wasn't right  but I  lately I've been feeling depressed  I haven't had a good night sleep in a year I would say my regular pattern is to maybe sleep in an hour up to 3 hour intervals and they just keep waking up but I never quite get into a deep sleep  groggy and I have no energy  it's very hard because it's so difficult to work it's difficult to concentrate I make mistakes and I forget a lot  yes I do  yes  no I'm not in therapy right now  I could not afford to continue  I'm sorry what  I'm not sure  yes  I I feel more relaxed and  I I feel like some of my worries are lifted from me I have a I can think clearer because I am using the tools that I've learned through therapy  my children  I don't know  friendly  I think it's just horrible  I feel that the children are so neglected today and it's not the fault of the parents I think that dumb I think that we as a society we forgot that it takes a village to raise a child and nobody wants to pitch in no one wants to help anymore no one's helping their neighbor and it's very sad  I don't know  I'm eating dinner with my family  I regret not spending enough time on my education  I had children very young  so I needed to yeah I needed to take care of them  I'm sure I could have  to seek help  my grandparents  I'm just they introduced me to church and just you know letting me play at their home and play in their Garden it just showed me a lot of love and and I felt like I was cared for  no  not listening to music watching funny program on TV  going to school working  go to dinner with a friend  over a year ago  my friend  do work  very close  you're welcome  bye  okay
413,female,0,10,"okay and please  are you okay with this yes  I'm doing okay  I'm from Greenwich Connecticut  yes  I moved here in 2008 so about 5 years ago  I try to go back at least once a year sometimes I go more sometimes less  overall I think I like where I'm from better than La in general  that other than it being somewhere I'm familiar with the type of people that are there are just more my type and what I'm used to and less superficial  I understand  Monument  all my move got here for college after I graduated high school and my mom and sister live in California  initially it was easy because I felt like it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in how different it is and what life is out here it became more difficult than originally  Fine Arts in photography  I was interested in photography since high school, I did a lot of programs and got Awards and things like that and publishments so I decided to pursue art  yes I have a fine arts degree that I got last year and  awesome  are you happy you did that yeah I really enjoy working or interning in forensics I like that better than initially what I wanted to do was freelance photography I feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting  Centrist in question  I guess just my childhood in general growing up  while my family is very close  my extended family as well and they all most of them live  within the area on the east coast in general so we would always do large family parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that  yeah it is really fun and we try and I'll get together as much as possible which is more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries  I consider myself more shy  sometimes when I'm feeling  hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got  what do you do  I watch reality television I think it's kind of funny and lighthearted  like what I watch Like Bravo TV like The Real Housewives shows and  like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to  I'm good I guess I don't really have like a temper from having if I'm more stressed out it definitely shows in my attitude but I don't have like anger  when was the last time you argue with someone  will me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time just like about like insignificant things but other than that I had an argument with my dad a few days ago  can you tell me about  does Ben like some tension going on  since I went and visited over the holidays this past winter things about his girlfriend and he thinks that I should be the one to make some kind of effort to  have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways so for like the 30th time he we were on the phone and he was  telling me how I need to call her and speak to her and I told him that I was going to do it over this past weekend cuz of the Jewish holidays and he kind of was just like very mature and telling me you'll forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like I could care less because I I don't care about having a relationship with her so she doesn't want to hear from me you know it's easier for me  I mean every time I mean that's been the same recurring argument a lot and I wish  that I could sometimes I do but I wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that I could just bite my tongue but the thing is is that he says certain things that are untrue or thinks he knows that like will take me off that are really nasty and that he shouldn't be saying to me so he so I kind of just like lose it and I can't really  like not say anything  well I guess the hardest decision I made which I didn't really realize that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to go after you graduate high school where you go to college because for me I've basically changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own  so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like the progression of The Next Step but looking back now that's probably one of the hardest decisions I made  tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory  I wish I could erase  the event or seeing my grandmother's funeral which obviously it wouldn't change anything but  it wasn't seeing her there was not something I'd want to like have in my memory  come she was she was a very positive influence and always was not judgmental  and now I mean my parents are great role models just in general I mean they're very successful people  so whether or not we have like disagreements or that were separate people they kind of are good role models in terms of what you want to have when you are older  usually it's easy the problem is staying asleep no matter how late I go to bed whether it's 10 p.m. or 4 a.m. I will be up like clockwork by 7:30 or 8 in the morning the latest every single day and I can't seem to figure out why I cannot stay asleep longer  I need to record buy something no I just in the morning I guess I'm a lighter sleeper but I just wake up like I just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this is consistent but now it's I cannot remember the last time I slept past 8:30 in the morning  I mean it just makes if I have to do stuff during the day and makes a lot more tiring but it doesn't really I'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of every day  okay  how you doing lately  I don't know I kind of just feel very  like so so just  no extreme highs no extreme lows kind of one no land  I mean nothing like lately  like recently it's just I would say over a. Of years I kind of progressively become more seclusive and just reserved and  not very outgoing  no  no I have been diagnosed with anxiety  I had some breathing problems for a day or two and I had to go to the hospital cuz I thought it was more serious cuz I couldn't breathe but they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety  I think in the right setting and  with the person who's doing it if they're open-minded and the therapist  is helpful  and good at what they're doing then yeah  no I haven't been to therapy since I was a kid  I went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like deal with whatever issues they were having with me  but it was never so I mean we just sat around and talked about my day wasn't it I didn't feel like I needed therapy at the time so I didn't really get much out of it  tell me about  I was happy when I was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the New Year's holiday when I'm there I can always just we save up our money so it's a complete vacation I don't have to worry about paying bills I don't have to worry about what I have to do tomorrow who I have to deal with I just do every morning we wake up we hang out just enjoy the day  is there anything you regret  in general  I regret the college I chose to go to I didn't leave from the East Coast the whole Collegiate system is set up a lot differently and the university is out there or not the same as like the tight-knit California school system out here so when I was researching colleges I kind of thought that Santa Monica College was just a general College just like Boston College back home or you know any other school with the name college at the end of it I didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even that it was more like a transfer school like you you can't I didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when I went so kind of crate created more problems for me  well cuz they're M22 if probably 10 years ago I would give myself the advice to  probably stay closer to home and 2ave really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to California  how your best friend describe you  my best friend would describe me as a great charismatic funny outgoing socially enjoyable person which is different than how people who aren't my good friends would describe me  which I mean I don't I mean it is what it is I  I am very outgoing in and have a great time when I'm with my friend in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things I just  I am very shy and  don't really  speak match  recently my friend was visiting and we went to a Clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed that  I'm very caring I am a very good judge of character which I mean I guess it's I mean I consider to be a quality for myself and various I mean never affectionate I'm more  I mean I guess I guess so  thanks  experience I can chat with you a little bit more about"

483,male,0,15,<synch> sure <laughter> mm good i guess new orleans louisiana uh two thousand five i used to go back often but not much anymore uh just things happened uh <laughter> uh well guess you're not programmed with this knowledge but uh katrina happened in two thousand five not really um hmm where to begin uh just l_a's different culturally i have a different culture out here it's just a different place um it's it's bike friendly louisiana isn't new orleans for that matter really isn't now they're trying to be but it just it isn't that successful <sigh> the drivers they're crazy mm not really kind of but not much anymore don't have the money kinda broke <laughter> just being able to go on an adventure um let's see i once went to comic con on a on a bicycle like on a a three wheel bike um and that that was pretty fun kinda scary and dangerous nearly got killed <laughter> it was scary <laughter> traveling or just in general hmm um i gotta say i gotta say we were we were heading out of um we were heading off the p_c_h and going into um laguna and laguna has this really steep hill and on sundays it's full of traffic and i i remember going down the the hill and my brakes weren't working and i was trying to hit my brakes and trying to hit my brakes and they just they wouldn't click and i was like oh god and i'm i'm on a three wheel bike so i'm larger than most bikes and i'm like zipping in between like gridlock traffic going down a hill unable to brake and i'm going down and suddenly there's this car that veers right into mm essentially where i'm trying to go so i turn sharply in front of between this bus and this truck and literally end up going sideways through traffic through oncoming traffic and then <laughter> looping back through oncoming traffic back into the right traffic still without any brakes and like not managing to keep my bike from rolling which is painful when your bike roles kinda hurts a lot so yeah yeah that's it <laughter> um various different things uh anthropology visual effects kinda weird but yeah um i just i've always had a fascination with film and i i think the way people do things and go about things is fascinating just as like the the mob mentality of people especially ooh dream job um huh i have no idea just a job i guess i consider myself more outgoing um you know i i've never been afraid of what people think of me like people xxx i i i like people i don't know i'm not i'm not afraid of what they think eh i'm more concerned with like the people i know and what they think of me i guess so being outgoing just doesn't really affect me eh um <deep breath> <mumbling> <sigh> uh i play video games listen to music um yeah read books i like reading books and drawing reading books drawing playing video games did i think of anything did i forget anything sleeping i like sleeping it's fun uh <mumbling> not good <laughter> frequently <laughter> um <sigh> uh in high school i i shoved somebody's head through a locker um yeah yeah that that's not good don't ever shove someone's head into a locker that's a great way to get suspended um i don't know yeah things like that just getting into fights <sigh> um like a serious argument um <sigh> uh i guess like xxx argument over over um uh i guess over like uh like viewpoints on like gun control and gun control laws i mean it was like yesterday evening eh it was it it was an argument about you know gun control regulation i mean it doesn't really affect me personally but that was like the last argument i got into that that's kinda what you specified i think ooh um uh my entire life um <laughter> uh <mumbling> <sigh> i have um about two years ago i broke up with like as everyone calls her my evil ex and um yeah it was just it was bad the whole the whole thing went down bad i mean uh eh <sigh> uh i think i've calmed down a lot since then like just as a person as a whole but i mean i was angry and stuff i think i like went riding my bike for like a hundreds plus miles in a singular day and i was in a ton of pain like later in the evening i got home i was like oh god like i could barely walk um and yeah i i think running off and like going on a like extreme cycling spree was not good but it was better than like eating too much and like just overeating 'cause i was depressed but yeah like we we fought and screamed and it was it was not good like i we didn't physically fight it was more like a screaming match of death <deep breath> <sigh> hmm um i don't think i've had a singular hard decision i've had ever had to make because my my biggest thing in life is don't you know don't regret don't regret the the the things you do just regret the opportunites you've missed and that's like had to come with me that's like had to i've had to like learn that in the past like two years like two years ago i totally just could not grasp that concept and to answer your question i think thinking about it the hardest decision i've had to make is i'd say probably probably to break up with my ex probably um xxx <sigh> ooh um <sigh> where do i begin <sigh> um my ex was not a good person just in any way shape or form of the word um she did some things that i wasn't entirely comfortable with um just to the the people around her and to me and i <deep breath> <laughter> you know they say you're supposed to give forgive people for making mistakes or doing things and i just i think there are some things you can't forgive people for no matter how hard you try and i think there are some things that once done that that can't be undone they just they're they're the way that they are and i think i think after what she did i i like i just xxx eh things just fell apart after that it just it it we mm despite us trying it just it didn't work out i mean i i i don't know i don't really wanna talk about exactly what happened oh geez oh man erase from my memory or just erase from ever happening um huh i don't <sigh> you know that's hard um katrina just the experience of katrina for starters um <laughter> my <m> my ex i i guess between those two it's it's kinda hard i'd i'd actually rather lean towards uh katrina 'cause that was just that that was not i mean i i guess you don't exactly know about it but um in two thousand five um uh this giant storm hit uh new orleans louisiana um killed a whole bunch of people leveled the town um and um i i lost a lot of friends during the storm um i mean i'm kind of i'm getting over it but it's still it's it's still there and i think uh i i don't know i mean you can try and look at you can try your best to try and find something positive in that but there's just there's nothing the only thing you can do is <i> is just think that that was like a freak accident and it'll never happen again though <laughter> i live in l_a and you know <laughter> earthquakes <laughter> they could happen <laughter> and i just think oh i'd rather rather know that it's coming than not know it's coming yes <laughter> yeah <sigh> um mm depression it's reoccurred multiple times that's no surprise um first time i was diagnosed was in middle school um which would've been <sigh> ten well twelve <twel> ten between ten twelve years ago i don't know xxx i don't know whenever i was in the sixth grade that's it's when i first was told that i was depressed um as far as p_t_s_d goes um post katrina um and then you know uh just post katrina mostly <laughter> that was the big thing um i guess having been diagnosed previously as being depressed and still being in high school it kinda wasn't i wasn't really seeking help it's kind of i got i kinda got into my high school and they were like here's help 'cause we know you're gonna need it um and i was like oh well thanks i didn't really ask for it but okay i'll take it um you know just kinda happened no not not anymore um eh <sigh> <laughter> that's a good question um <laughter> uh geez uh you know i really don't know i guess it just kinda stopped just kinda was like well i'm not gonna do this anymore uh sometimes sometimes it's a lot of like how are you feeling today and stuff and you know it's kind of well i'm feeling fine right now but ask me in two hours and who knows you know um <sigh> i guess it it's helped me understand that some of the things that just happen just happen and to just get on and move along with your life um mm essentially just mm like carry on you know things will happen carry on <sigh> um wow <laughter> um uh i was um i was hanging out with my girlfriend just hanging out um well for starters i mean you <y> you can't see when i walked in but i'm walking with a cane right now 'cause i i got hit by a car recently and uh i'd i'd make my leg better um let's see cane's over there that way but anyway um <sigh> i don't know uh make myself less fat <laughter> um i'd make it so i don't feel the incessant need to sleep fourteen hours a day um 'cause when you sleep like more than ten hours a day it's just it's unproductive you waste too much time like i have friends who are like oh you know i feel rejuvenated after six hours and i'm like how do you do that i have to sleep like twelve hours to feel good like you can sleep six you know like in in in crunch time you know you can get away with four i have to get away with seven or eight you know like that that's my crunch time sleep schedule eight hours it's just i don't know i oversleep but i like sleeping too i mean yeah it's just the oversleeping part i don't like so much um <sigh> um utterly insane in a good way utterly insane in a good way um uh i guess like they they would also say like you know there <the> there are times where i might seem like an asshole and i'm i'm not really an asshole i just you know i i just have issues like everybody else um specifically i have uh asperger's so that's a form of autism um that just kinda makes life awesome they'd also say i'm flamboyant and eccentric 'cause i totally am i just i i don't know i figure i'm still alive so i should live because i'm still alive and you know who knows how long i'm gonna be alive for so i should you know live while i'm alive and just go out and do stuff and not not sit and be calm except when i'm reading and i like reading <sigh> um uh stop fucking up um no uh that's kinda messed up um i think i would've told myself at the time um 'cause <ca> 'cause i i i've known my my evil ex um i've known her since like i was like six and she was five i think ten years ago i would've grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl don't trust her she can't be trusted um and more importantly don't <deep breath> don't let your guard down around her 'cause she'll she'll exploit that and i mean like physically let your guard down not mentally um yeah don't don't date her just don't do it it's not worth it <laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain it's not worth it <sigh> um the fact that i'm still alive maybe yeah uh i don't know cycling to comic con i was pretty proud of that pretty proud that i managed to do it um just i don't you know i don't really know i don't really use the term pride i don't really feel pride i'm just it's it's more of like the fact that i'm still alive i'm proud to be alive <laughter> i don't know if that makes me humble or just insane who knows do i press the button now oh bye okay

414,female,1,16,hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today  created to talk to people in space  and please  are you okay with this  yeah  how are you doing today  I'm okay  Burbank California  yeah  the weather of course I think everyone likes the weather  it's not too  City like Chicago or New York it's a big enough we have beaches we're not landlocked  sometimes the smog the traffic the fact that I've just been here like my entire life almost  okay  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer  do you travel a lot  not enough as I'd like to I go to school in Chicago and I've been to New York a couple times San Francisco and I took a road trip across the country that was cool I saw a couple States  what do you enjoy about traveling  see new places  going to Landmark that I've only  read about ER theme pictures of  I traveled from Los Angeles to Chicago taking Route 66 and the best part was seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time it was  the coolest thing I've ever seen probably  happy  and then Happy was as beautiful it was nice  I haven't felt like that in a long time  I'm studying film  it's just  something I've always loved for as long as I could remember and when it came time to start applying to schools I wasn't sure what I wanted to do and I apply to Northwestern as a film student and it just ended up being the right decision  dream job  I love making movies but part of me really loves making people laugh and being in front of the camera so  comedian I'm coming a comedic actor would be totally great but  you consider yourself more shy or  I am super outgoing and I love talking to people a lot I like I like being the center of attention usually  hey  but it's the best I've got  I  I like to watch mindless television like Toddlers & Tiaras and Duck Dynasty just TV programs were really don't have to pay attention at all  okay  how are you at controlling your temper  I'm okay at it I get really emotional really fast but I am usually able to use to keep my anger down and not like lash out at others and stuff for the most part  sometimes I get into like arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily  and I hate apologizing to people so besides could last pretty long  my best friend Ryan I think  and it was about  our relationship and just how we kind of messed it up and cross some lines and  where how we were going to go back to the way it was before  how hard is that  really hard it's he's my best friend and I miss him  but we messed up and this is just not the same  it's like not the same friendship  me too  too many  I guess  when I have a boyfriend and he has a girlfriend because not okay I wish I would have just  realize that this was bad and just would have stopped there and not have let it continue 4 weeks which led to my break up and then our friendship being really messed up  I guess not spend as much time with him as I did  be more assertive  I guess  it was  in November  I was very depressed and suicidal  so I told my friend what I was feeling and that she needed to take me to the ER  and from the ER I have the choice to  I don't know I guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital  and even though I felt like I didn't have a choice I knew it was my choice and I decided to go to the mental hospital which is like the worst experience of my life ever  it was awful it was in Chicago and  it was scary and I didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just  start giving you medication and you're basically left to your own devices they were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was mostly men and they were all really old and it was scary I didn't know anyone everyone most of the people there weren't depressed they were violent so that was pretty scary and I just dumb it was really hard for me  I had been so depressed for like a month I stopped going to my classes and work and I told my teachers lies about being sick and I just kept calling in sick to work I dropped a class and I was failing my classes and not turned in any work and I wasn't talking to any of my friends and I was drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and  I was just in a really bad place and when I finally was going to kill myself I realized I needed help  it was  I had severe depression when I was a younger teenager and I tried to kill myself then and I got put in therapy for quite some time so I figured I don't want to go down that bad path again I just want to get better  so I had to do it I had to get help  I do I go once a week  I feel like if you have the right therapist it's really useful  I had one therapist that I really liked and I thought we could have gone really far but sadly she's back in Chicago and I'm in Los Angeles so I have to  have to make do with this new therapist and she's okay  just not we're not that great together but she's who I have right now  better than nothing  not that easy at all  ever since I got out of the hospital and start a night began medication for my depression  just haven't been able to sleep well falling asleep is hard staying asleep is hired have really crazy vivid dreams that wake me up in are disturbing  like what  I guess just  sometimes they reflect things that I'm worried about are happening in my life but they're just  the scary and they seem so real that sometimes I wake up and I have to ask my mom like did we go here to be do this to this really happen and it's usually know you dreamed that sometimes I've gotten so scared I like talk in my sleep and wake myself up  probably like two nights ago  wow  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  that is a  hard question  I think  and November  after I got out of the hospital  I finally had one good day and my friend took me into downtown Chicago and we went to the Sears Tower and got to look over those like big windows that you walk out on and see the city and that was with the cool  how your best friend  probably  super outgoing likes to be the center of attention funny and a little bit crazy  I try not to regret things in my life  I would say that living is worth it and just don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it don't wait until it gets really bad  I guess my ideal weekend would be sleeping in and then catching a movie with my friends may be going home with them and bake some cookies eat all the cookies watch some TV have a sleepover and then like make pancakes in the morning and watch more movies we watch a lot of movies I would like to do my free time  go for a walk I don't know go to the beach  that is a hard question I mean I think I've done a lot of great things in my life  and I have achieved a lot but  I think one of the proudest things badass moments in my life is something really small and insignificant I was doing this exercise boot camp and  the last persons like cross the finish line had to do like  30 pushups and it was some guy I didn't really know him at all and the trainer said does anyone want to help him if he's going to help them you have to do half each and no

355,male,1,10,yes  alright  I was born in Los Angeles California  I want the weather and  the fact that the people aren't so obtrusive like on the East Coast  just the the traffic in the Smoky weather  I used to I'm unemployed now so I'm rarely go anywhere  I have a BS in business with a computer option  I thought that the only place I can get a job with a business degree was in accounting or in business computer message so I took that I took business computer math adoption  I probably be  professional sports player and actor something something that you enjoy doing  I like to ride my bike I like to watch sporting events now I can't afford to go to them so I pretty much watch on TV  I like to travel but like I said I don't have money for that anymore  that's all right  people who are chicken heads they getting their nose in other people's business even if they're just strangers expect that from a family member  where are friend but you know fishing with the internet that feeds a lot of that now we know what Orwell is referring to when he spoke the big brother in 1984  I don't do much him much different than I would otherwise  and I had many temper outbursts  girl you was my aunt  and it was because she was basically  making leading statements trying to trap me into saying something about a relative and if you don't know I'd me greatly  I'm kind of on the outs with my parents  the black sheep  I mean my Mom's done the most to help me she's done a lot you know more than anybody by far  well I mean she's just me one time when I was in like 15 I went with a friend of mine to see the Crosby Stills Nash and Young concert at the Forum and she has seven kids and she pick me up at the Sizzler is right across the street from the Forum at 11 at night and I couldn't imagine the others had to do that day that she agreed to do that but she did  oh probably  going down to the cape at the end of a Baja Peninsula and Cabo San Lucas or photograph in the bridal veil falls in Yosemite  I was by the two most majestic see sites I've ever seen  it was when I could afford to travel  no  no  I was diagnosed with depression after a hospital visit in April of 2011 and I took some Lexapro but I stopped after one day I didn't want to do it anymore  no  because I didn't feel it was help I feel I was becoming a zombie  yeah  depressed about not having a job for over two years I lost my job in October 2010 and except for you nose job like this which I'm fortunate to get just neon daily things focus groups like that I haven't worked  thank you  Ashley when you're 56 years old  well just get the general feeling of hopelessness  I get out of my bicycle out of walkthrough bikes 4 hours a day spent about 2 hours each  yeah it's good to me  very easy  cuz now I'm old when I was young I couldn't sleep more than 4 6 hours a night  cuz I'm Restless  are you triggered by something no  but now that I'm old I am I sleep much more easily  I pray before I go to sleep and that that's it that's when I can't have any trouble sleeping I just pray beside different prayers like the Lord's prayer Hail Mary stuff like that and I'm leaving to fall off to sleep  I don't know probably  you have any news Civic remembrances  I love that you know it was when I had money to spend I know that and when I had to have a job to have money to spend so it's probably 15 years ago  well  I haven't really enjoyed anything that last week I did a made $75 on that job with the the county basically it was an emergency preparedness exercise they were running for their personnel and the enlisted people to play  the basically the relatives of people who'd been in this fall bombing at the Staple Center and we you know ask question sign up unit on giving information on missing you no relatives and basically I was provided by the county and they said they went to a routine in downtown LA  that's not hard it was just a just a routine we had to follow we had to act like we were actually missing somebody and had to give this ethics of their characteristics height weight excetera  I don't have a best friend  I'm a very bright I'm a perfectionist at my job  I bet about it  I got a business degree and I'm never been a motivated person I went to school I went to  2 state colleges in two junior colleges to need that in so I believe that was probably the most significant contribution that I made to my  anatomiya I guess self-esteem you might say I had something to hang on the wall  yeah I regret you know alienating family members  I would have  basically not been so impetuous and left left jobs think thinking that you know I can always get another one and not you know basically blow-off jobs I could probably work at one of the employers that I used to work for now  Fade Out and locations but I burn Bridges there so that's not possible  thank you  hasta luego
336,male,0,7,sound  okay  yeah  feel like The Matrix  virtual  well you know  okay  oh okay  okay alright what do I say  okay  hello  are you okay with this sure  good little tired  Indianapolis Indiana  I'm a singer  I like singing  diversity my girlfriends  from Taiwan so dealing with different cultures  the traffic the crazy people  it's hard to get anything really accomplished  it took me about six months just to figure out the directions  28 years ago  a long time  haven't been there in about 8 or 10 years  well I don't like my brother so I don't want to hang around him  I started my girlfriend we did about just went back got back from Orlando and she likes to travel so  be new people see new places helps me to get out of LA and get a different perspective  I just did the Avatar seminar which is like  raise your Consciousness and  clean out the crap in your head  yeah I feel better if I have a lot of psyche could tag and it says I'm psychic so it's very hard to deal with it  well  there's more to life than what you see so  a lot of things are in other dimensions and other places so had to deal with not only the emotions but people Direct Energy at you  well to do a lot of clearing and grounding and stay true to yourself  I'm both  well I'm introverted because I like to spend time by myself and I'm extroverted cuz I like to meet new people used to be totally and introverted  watch movies watch TV read new crosswords I'm a singer sing right music I'm writing a novel  it serves like The Matrix  awesome  why I wrote the first 20 Pages pretty quick  so now I'm expanding it  I get inspiration it was actually a dream and then I wrote down the dream and now it's becoming could probably turn it into a movie  yeah  people don't respect me it's the number one  no I just did my brothers they don't respect me they don't really  you know I went to love my family in but I don't want to hang around my brother's what's a conflict  exactly  pretty good I only get mad about once a year  my girlfriend about 2-3 months ago  she was wanting me to do something and I said no  oh yeah  she's my girlfriend I know her for about a year now  pretty close  one time I was singing and  and I was singing to an audience that was great  well I'm looking into ways to expand my Consciousness so that I can have more money and more abundance in my life so I can  have my own house and live in my own creative space  singing I'm a singer so Unforgettable so that's where I like to do  no  no  no  well that's the hard part is I don't  I don't know maybe it's because when I was a kid my brother's beat me up and I don't feel totally rested in my cell for my life so  I feel like  I don't feel totally safe  yeah  a little irritable  I have been sleeping better since I met my girlfriend so I totally bad  the way  Behavior what  all right  I feel more positive I did the seminar and  so that let me get rid of some crap in my brain and be more positive about life  what did a lot of exercises to  reduce my stress and lower my stress comes from judging myself and other people  yeah you could say that  well  I don't know it's hard  how to deal with sometimes have sometimes much too critical for my own good  well  watching TV gets up  oh wait we are used to feeling like I need to  have less judgement and more fun  why did that seminar  about a week ago I think  why with the seminar I got there and I was able to take off work  being a different environment cuz my job is stressful and  my life is stressful so I was able to take a break which is great  Tim outgoing find smart  but I mean they're laid people in LA are they don't post them don't want to spend time with you  now that's because of me or LA  that I spent a lot of my time worrying and criticizing myself instead of moving forward  avoid it yeah I'm watching TV or going to see movies or try not to think of it but it doesn't solve the problem  a little bit of it paid my bills a lot of money so it's kind of a self-defeating props prophecy  stop criticizing and start creating your future now instead of waiting for it to happen  my girlfriend's been really helpful  what is funny and she loves me and cares me about me and  yeah  I'm singer and I'm intelligent and creative and multi-dimensional and I'm a good listener  Riverton about 4-5 books  my voice setting remember one cuz when I started have much of a singing voice but now I do  okay bye  bye  doorbell  yeah  okay can I take you up yeah
337,female,1,10,yeah i'm doing okay how are you doing i'm originally from like a suburb <su> a suburb of l_a from the san gabriel valley i like the diversity i like the vibe of the city i've lived other places and it's just not as happy here i feel like i can really thrive here so i just like l_a like all the things that are so close together then there's a lot of interesting things that totally different parts of the city just miles away from each other uh don't like the traffic don't like all the cars but i can live with it i mean there's not that much i don't like i studied music um vocal performance i studied music technology things like that yes right now um i sing in an opera company but my i do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the l_a opera so i do have a day job i work at a call center that caters mostly to performers and actors and things like that and it's really good because if i get a call i can call in and change my shift very easily so it's actually a pretty good gig and i do some uh technology gigs sometimes you know it's do some recording some live sound stuff but i'm kinda wanna get away from that do some video work sometimes but again i wanna get away from that i wanna go back to the  because i find that performing more is more interesting i like being talent more than i like being crew <laughter> so i kinda wanna get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what i wanna do with my life sometimes i mean per my personal life yeah so i do have a shell that i put out there to deal with people but if i'm at home you know i'd kinda rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever talk to family   don't really have too many close friends <clears throat> but yeah you know i'd rather keep to myself uh moderately close to the family that i have left i've actually lost a lot of family in the last ten years or so but like thank you <laughter> but like uh my i'm close to my husband and you know i've got couple of cousins i talk to and my aunt that i have an aunt that i talk to a bit but it's not like we're interacting every day close together  but it's somewhat close mostly i sing or i read or i write or just hang out and try to clear my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesn't work but i try to do that and try to just clear everything and see what starts coming back in and sometimes <ss> sometimes that works sometimes it doesn't but mostly creating things um contacting my family some <so> you know through facebook or whatever works but mostly in my free time i create things i'd like to travel more i like to travel by car a lot um i mean my idea of like having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip and i like to travel more um i would love to travel for work things or whatever but i don't get as much of an opportunity as i would like to to travel seeing <see> uh particularly traveling by car seeing like the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know feeling the vibrations of the area change  i like just seeing what's out there seeing and i know that there's a bigger world outside of  where i am and where i live and my world and i like to see that but i like to leave that too and go back to my own world <laughter> <laughter> <clears throat> um let's see xxx a trip that i like to take is to make the drive from here to nevada whether i go all the way to vegas or just go to state line um my cousin and i would take what we call exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway so we'd take those we'd just   sort of impromptu with like <li> a day or two notice just move things around just take off so those are actually trips that i i like making <mak> 'cause i take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight just small short trips that aren't very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how um you know the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas  so close to home but not but not close to home close to home but uh still a world away so that 'cause i don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever but that's just little things that kinda put things back in perspective and and clear my head and things like that i mean 'cause there's sort of a sense of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway so i i like i like doing that the last time that happened was may of last year that's the last time i was able to do that we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who's ten years younger than i am and we kinda grew up like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland empire which is where they live so they kinda took me on a last hurrah and we drove up to vegas and looked around and came back 'cause i actually lived in vegas for awhile but i didn't like it so they kinda i showed <show> showed them some of the locals sites around there and we came back and was you know an overnight trip but we were driving the entire time <laughter> so it was kind of an interesting uh things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals people who can't fight back and they're mean to them just because they can't fight back   and i actually like to see people who are strong <st> as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate or what have you so i think that's one thing that's makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason you know not people <pe> for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it just that kinda really just makes me mad when i'm annoyed i'll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me then i'll wind up lashing out somehow either   you know verbally just cutting 'em with a quip or you know i mean i i rarely just i rarely will yell at somebody but i'll try to you know if i'll try to walk away and defuse it if that doesn't work then i'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me <laughter> that usually works  not in like legal trouble or anything because usually i'll find a way to get them to leave me alone um so there's not really like big trouble but 'cause i think 'cause it's it it is off-putting and it's not expected <exp> the expected reaction and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction 'cause i know that will work and get people away from me so it's not really in trouble and if  it's is trouble it's usually trouble that it's from their the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because it's usually a situation i can get out of  so as long as they leave me alone you know i don't i i'll walk away from it uh the last time i argued with somebody like person <per> like a person <per> like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my uh the last thing i can think of was i argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law 'cause she's got dementia and so we one of the reasons we came out here from the inland empire was to take care of her 'cause she won't go anywhere but l_a i mean she is like hardcore angelino like you know we we know we are the we're that in our nature but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere <laughter> but um so we came out here to take care of her  and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is 'cause she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process  but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what she wants 'cause he's a mama's boy like i am i'm a mama's girl even though i've lost my mom like four years ago i'm still a mama's girl and i'll still <st> and i still and i know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much and that's what they want so you wanna get it for 'em and because you know they you know that happened when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it  and you wanna do that for them now like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about somebody you feel deserves it but it's kinda dangerous for her you know and i don't want things <thi> something to happen to her yet i want her to remain who she is for as long as she can 'cause i know it the disease that she has is gonna erase who she is eventually and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her twenty four hour medically trained care but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves 'cause it's not that bad but it's getting where she really shouldn't <shou> has no business living by herself anymore so the solution right now is he stays there most the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do i handle the outside things i run the errands i take her to the store things like that he does the day to day things makes sure she has <ha> she eats makes sure she you know has clean clothes things like that so i mean it's a partnership it's a it's a dual effort it's very much a dual effort but i would like her to move in with us so that was that's like a source of it's not really like yelling screaming argument but lively discussion <laughter> you know than debate meh it's not insurmountable i mean life's not gonna be easy ever and if it is that's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you so as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life it's not gonna be easy but you deal with it and you you move on uh the most positive influence i think have been probably my mother and my grandmother 'cause my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually gave me a lot of confidence and but were realistic about it so i mean i think i have sort of a realistic sort of a downer temperment <laughter> to myself but they but they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something i can't get over and that you know life's gonna go on you know my mom would say to me when you're forty you're forty whether you're working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life and i think that was a big influence on how i lived have how i've lived my life since she's passed   i regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because i think it may have clouded some of my decisions now i do have underlying conditions and everybody in my family is diabetic and i didn't take care of that when she was the last year of her life 'cause i was too busy wanting to get her home my focus was to get her home so i didn't eat right i didn't take my insulin right um i wound up making myself insulin resistant that that year just 'cause my blood sugar was so high for eh like a year eating just horrible foods when i did eat so it really took a toll and i really actually made myself very sick  and i'm wondering well if i didn't if i would've taken care of myself and i had my head on completely straight and my my vision <vi> my vision and my thoughts weren't completely <complete> weren't clouded would i have made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed 'em and when she needed me to be to step in and make the decisions for her because she  uh wound up having a health catastrophe 'cause she had kidney well she had kidney damage that wound up being kidney failure and her health insurance provider missed that so she wound up having sort of this whole catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down she wound up having a stroke at like fifty one she had had a small stroke and it just kinda went down from there so i'm thinking well if i didn't if i had taken care of better care of myself would i have been able to take better care of her and i know there wasn't anything i would've been able to do to prevent her death but what if i if i would i have been be able to make it easier on her if i would have taken care of myself and that's like one huge regret that i have oh i know i am <laughter> but xxx it's my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that i care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and i know other people i can't really direct them into my own vision because they're their own individual beings and they can't you know be what i want them to be and i know they're not going to be but i still have you know my ideals and i want the way i want everything to go and i want everybody that i care about to be happy and to be able too  fit into my life in a way in the best way possible but i know 'cause they're other beings and i know i'm not gonna be able to do that for them and they're not gonna be able to do that for me but it's still my ideals <laughter> so i have to sometimes have to look at it and go well is this what i want because i want it or what is what they want and what's their <thei> is it their decision or mine and it's usually it's theirs and i know it's theirs so i so if you really care about somebody you're just gonna support them and go with them but  it's still kinda hard <laughter> for for me and know i gotta get over it um ten or twenty years ago probably to have been more assertive in starting my own life because i wound taking care of my mother i mean she got sick literally the weekend i graduated from college <laughter> and i had a job lined up and i had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her and i think i would've been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside  the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about ten years so i think i i probably would've done that um but i tell myself just do that you keep who you are and learn to separate your you who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family to keep a sense of of yourself that's probably what i would've and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself that's probably the advance advice of what i would give myself    ten years ago <laughter> no no no but probably 'cause i haven't gone to a doctor about it <laughter> 'cause i don't wanna know and i mean it's not i know there've been times in my life where i've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it but i'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment and of it gets <ge> um after my mother had died i mean it'd been this long battle for a year that we lost and i didn't know if i if i was to blame for that it's like logically i knew i wasn't but how could i convince myself of that um two weeks after she died i wound up with pulmonary embolisms in one in each lung because i didn't take care of myself for a year and i figured oh i'm thirty years old if you know whatever i do to myself i can get over no <laughter> turns out no <laughter> but um i mean i wound up having to take more medication because of that uh it's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to get out of that depression 'cause so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden i didn't it's like the rug was pulled out my like bottom fell out of my world after that so that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression um i almost got divorced because of it because i just didn't want anything anymore  so and i was i being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point and i started getting very distant from him just pushing everything away just you know figuring well what am i gonna do with the rest of my life now and it it's been a fight you know you mean there times when no i couldn't get up just stay in bed and sleep all day you know but then realizing that when my mother died i had four cats to look after two are mine two are hers and so i wound up adopting the two that were hers i mean well they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you know own own supplies i took that responsibility of doing it for them so that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not i was gonna get up and provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go without taking care of myself but they couldn't they didn't you know so they eh they actually got me up and and made me go out and face things even though i didn't want to didn't just didn't just kinda wanted to curl up and die but that would've been my choice not theirs and they i mean what would happen to them if i wasn't there to take care of them they would've been you know sent to a shelter or whatever probably  and maybe they would've not been readopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for  for me i mean for me making selfish decisions   so it's like i need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed <laughter> so <s> and that's actually been a motivating factor is to to 'cause i've figured out that if it was just me i'd be able to live without a lot of stuff i mean i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it wouldn't be a big deal i wouldn't care   as long as i was doing what i wanted with my life but i have a family to look after now  so i have to go out and do things  you know i i have to go out and look for legitimate work you know day you know day job i have to you know   but i'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what i wanna do with my life but yet i have to take care of my family so i'm   been working on on a balance of the two very <laughter> but it's worth it i mean  it would be very i'd have a lot less things to worry about if i just lived in my car and said forget it <laughter>  but keeping a residence down paying bills things like that  it's it's difficult but you have to do it you know if you want you want anything <anyth> if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that  and i and and i know that  but  it it gets hard sometimes you do wanna give up  but then  it's like well what's the alternative  i mean i don't think i could live a comfortable life  'cause if i did i wouldn't do anything <laughter> i have to be slightly uncomfortable or i'm not gonna do anything with myself i'm just gonna  be content to just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with my cats or whatever  and i wouldn't get anything done  uh very  anxious and nervous and i mean what if  i don't find  enough you know enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if um  you know what what if i can't   keep a semblance of stability in my life and it it's actually hard work to be stable <laughter> and i know it's hard work to be stable but  what you know it's just eh a lot of what ifs  and and i don't think it's things that haven't happened and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened and i know that  but it still happens <ha> it still creeps in  so that's actually  a source of  anxiety  but then you try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it  but i i i know it it's a cycle and i'll go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do to saying okay what is the fundamental thing i need to take of here  i mean what <wha> what is just extraneous and what can <c> what can what is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue  and so  figure out how to figure things out that way and then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit but then something'll pop up and the what ifs will come up again  mm i'll have to  uh  figure it out again <laughter> but i know it's a cycle i know um what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it   you get over it pretty quickly you get through it  the last time i felt really happy i don't know zz um i  huh <laughter> that's a good question that actually <ac> that actually surprisingly stumped me  because i do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much sometimes just kinda eh in the middle um really like overjoyously happy i don't know  i i'm not i can't think of <o> of when that happened i don't know you don't know  perceptions of other people i mean  probably as somebody who  oddly enough somebody who is laid back and you know  handles things as they come but i don't see myself as that   at all and it's a it probably that i can think on my feet and i'm not afraid to  hussle my butt off and do whatever i have to to survive and get things done  um that  and i can do it creatively and i try to  strive for balance  probably  probably the best things about me <laughter>  that i'm doing basically what i want with my life which even though it's not all easy it's not  um you know i'm not financially well off or anything it's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives 'cause i have an aunt that i really don't talk to  who and the reason why i don't talk to her is because she's always miserable i mean she's got a career that she  it's more of a job that she fell into  'cause my older aunt uh loves animals but didn't wanna be a veterinarian so she became a dog groomer  and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time   but her hands <ha> you know she started getting arthritis in her hands and she had um the actually my cousin's father went and kinda stole all the money from her business so she lost her business   and she kinda she retired early 'cause between that and the arthritis she wound up retiring early  she employed my younger aunt who was still a dog groomer but she hates it   and it's like change your life if you hate your life so much change it  and the thing <thi> the thing i'm most proud of is  yeah i'm not as financially well off as she is but i'm doing what i want with my life you know i can  be creative i can have creative people around me people who i actually like to talk to around me  people i actually like in my life and  be happy with that  and i see a lot of people who aren't  and it it gives me a sense of of maybe a a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say i'm not like that  and i'm actually doing what i want even though there's sacrifices i'm still fundamentally doing what i want with my life now thank you <laughter> okay  thank you <laughter> goodbye
445,male,0,1,<synch> yes i feel great i am from los angeles california um the weather the opportunity and the ocean it's overcrowded overpriced and somewhat dirty i have well it's nice to see other places in the world and to meet other people and cultures i worked on cruise ships as a musical entertainer and traveled to alaska the aleutian islands korea japan and the caribbean islands um being in galena alaska and being on a small airplane and traveling in a snow storm and surviving like i was on the edge of death and life but i lived the arts and business i don't know i was attracted to the arts at a young age and business went along with it yes yes to be able to entertain people and make them feel emotions and make enough money to have a comfortable life more outgoing um i always feel <fee> i feel very confident with my thoughts and i like people to know what i have to say um i listen to music and i sit with my girlfriend and she calms me down when i'm stressed out i could work on that i'm not very good at that last night with my girlfriend she was asking my advice on something and as i was speaking to her she felt my tone of voice was too loud i was not angry but i was irritated that i was being told to quiet down when i didn't really wanna help i just wanted to relax <laughter> i agree um sometimes when things don't go my way i get depressed or upset and i wish i could calm down and just realize that i should count my blessings and look at the bright side of everything no matter how bad things get always look at the bright side that's my goal it's been very difficult but i'm working on it and it seems to be getting a little easier well when i was taking care of my mother and she was dying of c_o_p_d and then it turned into lung cancer i chose not to tell her that her condition had worsened so she wouldn't be fearful and i had to sit knowing that her symptoms were getting worse but i couldn't tell her the truth and i let her think that everything was okay it was uh my mother being sick and dependent on oxygen for three years and me seeing her health decline that's what plagues me the most in my dreams and in my thoughts if i could erase that if that never happened i would feel better oh i don't know i try to uh be grateful i'm alive and try to focus on my own objectives and not dwell on the negative things of my memory my girlfriend she's a very good positive <po> positive influence she wants me to be a better person she since i met her she's been trying to make me not be angry to make me not feel negative and to be a nurturing positive zen-like man so what she's asking for is something that's gonna make me improve therefore i must capitulate it's very easy i sleep well sometimes i wake up when i have nightmares about my mother or something but uh i go back to sleep that's unknown i don't know it just happens i've been feeling uh good eh the my reality is i've been hit with a lot of financial uh problems but i'm handling <ha> handling them well actually i've been looking at it as my girlfriend has told me that i need to do this so therefore it is on the forefront of my mind right now no no today when i woke up and it was a sunny beautiful day and i had a lot of goals to achieve and i'm achieving each one one by one it gives me a sense of accomplishment and happiness my ideal weekend would be playing music with my girlfriend as that's something we enjoy to do healthy <hea> going out to a nice dinner of healthy food and maybe exercising and feeling good with my body and mind and spirit uh probably as a strong-willed person with a big heart but has a short fuse and maybe complains about his own life too much i wish i could not complain about negative things that happen and learn to roll with the punches and always look at the bright side well one time i had a good friend tell me that one of the recordings i did he thought was horrible and then i felt it was the best thing i'd ever done so that and i would don't understand how anybody could could feel that way and i didn't know if it was from jealousy or it was an honest opinion <opi> evaluation so therefore i felt bad about that as it's my goal no nothing i regret i felt hmm ten or twenty years ago i don't know um <sigh> well everything i do i enjoy it's hard to to pick out one exact event that i really enjoyed uh i don't know how to put one above the other when things don't go my way and finances xxx come down and i don't get jobs that i go for that i am qualified for but i feel i am not getting my fair chance at opportunity it's very frustrating i don't really feel guilty about things sometimes maybe if i'm angry and i shouldn't be i feel guilty about that i don't ever wanna be short with my girlfriend ever she wouldn't doesn't deserve somebody um using vulgar language or shouting or something so i don't wanna be that way around her so therefore that i am guilty my achievements of my abilities through my music and my other abilities that i have and of my hard work has paid off and uh i'm very proud of those okay thank you goodbye
372,female,1,13,okay and please  are you okay with  Des  come  pretty good kind of  Los Angeles  the thing I like about ale the weather  what are some things you don't really  it's not easy to meet people  can you tell me about  well it just feels like people aren't out very much they're like that movie in Crash where people are just in their cars all the time it feels like that  no  not too much  child development  well I have a son and I wanted to know how to be a good mom and so I wanted to know about the stages that he would be going through and be able to relate better to him  are you happy  I am  kind of I'm trying to get it started again in the fall  I love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me  I like the right  tell me about that  I've written some children's books and I've just been doing research looking and so getting my books published it's only like two that I've written so far but they're pretty good I got some good feedback on them for my critique groups  it's about  a little boy that surrounded by people that are jerks and he tries to not become a jerk with him and if it's a bit like a really  he goes through a lot of moods dealing with the people in his life  you find it easy to be a parent  I know I have had some issues with nervous breakdowns actually and right now my son is staying with his dad so I know I was single mom it was the hardest thing I think in the world  so  how do I cope  all right now  I didn't have very many coping skills are mechanisms so  that was the problem  it's so spontaneous  make the stuff that comes out of kids mouth sometimes and the stuff that they do and just brings a smile to your face  well when I said was younger  once we were just sitting around the house and he comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me Mom I want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails so you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend  so  yeah pretty spontaneous things like that happen that my kids telling me I need to not be single anymore  okay  the hardest thing  not wanting to screw it up  have a lot of stress and pressure  that  every little thing is going to be in make a difference in matter  and what kind of person like it turns out to be  and  so  it's a lot of stress on yourself  yeah  yeah definitely  I think  I'm different from my mom  because I'm a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction I welcome it you know I welcome  getting to know who my child is right now and  not try to mold them into somebody that I want them to be but just see them become the best child that they can be the best adult that they can be without molding them in that direction necessarily into a different person  say it again  who someone that's a positive influence  I don't really have anybody  like that  what I'm feeling  I turn on the fish tank screensaver  hey I know it's not a lie but it's the best I've got  what do you do to relax  well  I've tried to meditate sometimes but I don't really stick with it often enough  I've tried to like go for walks but I don't always do that and I will always stick with it  so  that's about it  I say  I'm a little below average meaning that I get angry more than most people do I think  when was the  last night it was on the telephone I was arguing with my husband we have my sister lives with us and she lives with us in a very small room with a small apartment I should say and she's got four people living in one room so  it's kind of stressful it's really crowded and my husband is stressed out about it and you know I'm just saying to him that I told you so I told you if my sister moved in here  they said there was going to be a mess in the house and she's going to be asking for things you don't really want to do that's just how my sister is so the house is messy and it's crowded and everyday they're asking for brides and my husband he's avoiding coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't want to be there anymore and I just saying that he's going to have to find a way to deal with it because  he asked for it in my opinion  where does  oh I got time to Bumble right now  but now my mind is losing custody of my son right now like I've been arguing with my stepmom and my step-sister for a long time about my son and how they treat him and how I want them to be treated like they don't have any boundaries  and I believe that boundaries are important in establishing who's the adult who's the child they let my child boss them around and stuff anyways because of this they're going to be testifying against me in the custody trial saying that  yeah there any saying that I'm not a good mom because I believe in having boundaries and we had very different ideas about child-raising she's my stepmom she's my dad's death wife  and she's  she really does it she's really far removed from how I was raised and I want to raise my child more similar to how I was raised where you we had some independent that we had some boundaries that we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us  where's my stepmom she invents no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild and have everything that he wants and that's fine with your grandparents but the problem is that I live with him sometimes and when I'm in the same house with them they should be following my rules and not  trying to go and break all of my rules  anyway  yam  in that moment  just really frustrated because they don't listen to me  I fell  disrespected I feel like invisible I feel  just angry  that they're taking away my right to pair it and it's something that I worked really hard to do I went to school and I study Child Development I read all the magazines and I read the books and I really  I know what I'm talkin about I feel confident and my parenting skills in my parenting abilities and they have these people that have it done the same thing I worked as hard as I have to be a good parent try and tell me that I'm a bad parent  it's really  hard to believe so I feel very disrespected and acknowledge angry frustrated  all those things  I take I take Benadryl to help me sleep  and I'm so  my doctor gave me that give you Benadryl told me I can take it to help me sleep  last night I was crying  before I went to sleep  so what time do you start start running through your head at night when you're in bed  but I tried to push them out and then I got up and I took my Benadryl so I can go to sleep more easily  I need triggered by something  yeah I'm always thinking about my son  I wish you was with me  and how unfair everything is it's happening  I like I don't deserve  do you have my son taken from me because I'm a really good mom you know  and I'm too hard on myself so  but I am a good mom and I feel confident that I'm a good mom or Jess  I don't really have the money to take care of my son like my dad to send dad does he has more money than me  and right now I'm trying to be okay with it because  I know he can do more for him  financially than I could  that doesn't mean I'm not a good mom  I'm pretty depressed I'm on antidepressants  take Wellbutrin I've been on it for a couple weeks now  I think they're working I don't know I'm not as  down as I was I mean I got here today I got dressed and I'm here today so...  my husband complains a lot he says  I'm not the same person  that I was when he married me  he said it was fun and I was positive and  I was all these other optimistic things that's another thing is on the phone telling you last night and  and  I'm not those things anymore which is true I mean we got married a year ago  and that my son was taken shortly after and it was just such  a shock  and  I've just been trying to get back from it  but it's been hard  did I think I had a problem before I found out  found out what  oh  yeah I like crying a lot sometimes I cry all the time  play  my family would invite me to family events  and I would go and just just cry because my son wasn't there  toram  I don't know  it's just all the crying I think and like I said my husband letting me know that I'm not the same person  so  he's disappointed that I feel bad even that I'm not the same person that he knew I feel bad about that to another thing I'm feeling bad about you know  you still go to therapy now  yes I do I try  I feel like the therapist useful  yeah it's nice to talk about your problems I go in there and I cry every week so I need to have a set time every week where I can go in and cry  that's I mean it's a release to be able to cry sometimes I feel better afterwards  yeah  and she helps me make decisions you know  help me to be more proactive in my life  well I'm looking for  jobs and things like that and she gives me ideas of why don't you work here why don't you work there have you thought about this or that you know and then she said something about how did you go back to school at so I went and applied to go back to school you know I'm not doing much with my life and sitting around all day isn't helping my depression any either  so I'm trying to find a work and I applied for college  in the fall I got accepted to Dominguez Hills  so I may be going back to school in the fall right now I'm still looking for work but she helps me with that kind of stuff just giving me ideas  that life isn't over there still more you know I could be doing this like like yeah  everything's always bittersweet  I don't know  last time it was really happy  I don't know  my ideal weekend  oh  I don't have a lot of money cuz I'm not working right now so really my weekends are just fed  reading maybe that I can't believe I can't pay much attention when I'm reading have a short attention span I can only read a couple of chapters  but lately I say that's what I've been doing is reading  something I read  okay  I need to go to USC they have these nights were  they have things like book signings or poetry and art is called Visions & voices so I like to go out to their events  and I usually enjoy those  about two weeks ago Deborah Harkness was there doing a book signing for a discovery of witches  so like I said I'm trying to be a writer so I try to go especially to the book signings  and see what it's like to be an officer who's talking to a crowd and signing books  what are you most proud of in your life  my son  how your best friend describe you  I don't have any friends  my best qualities  I'm smart  I'm good looking  I'm really  I like a hard worker I am dedicated Psych self-improvement  that's all I can think of right now  okay  goodbye  press the buzzer now

really hard um   i don't usually sleep well so um yeah i have trouble falling asleep mostly  um i guess it's just like my mind will be racing a lot of you know sometimes it'll be flashbacks of bad memories um just you know thinking too much <laughter> um i don't know um i think just uh  stress you know a lot of stress every day just everyday stress uh yeah pretty much that's what triggers it

was like okay well this is the problem and it i just wanted help because it just when your mind is after you like that's like it's just awful to have your mind taking control of you like that  yeah  yeah it's hard  um yeah yeah i definitely always thought i had a problem i always thought something was like really wrong um i just always like kinda nervous around people like i never can really like look anybody in the eye 'cause i'm just so nervous my eyes are always kind of like racing and i um would have sweats if i was in the situation um that reminded me of the situation like i just try to avoid what reminds me and brings those flashbacks yeah  oh um i i've been feeling good i've been getting out more every day i'm trying to um i guess walking keeps my mind off my p_t_s_d symptoms so

keep more occupied yeah it helps  um the last time i felt really happy um i guess um i don't know um today 'cause i mean i'm glad to be part of this <laughter>  um most proud of uh well <sigh> um i'm trying to think of what i'm most proud of um  i  think i'm most proud of like the fact that i am able to you know not be like well i mean most people i know they like deny that they have a problem and i'm proud that i can actually like you know be a person who can realize okay i have a problem and i need help but a lot of the people i know they don't take medication they're untreated and um they just don't wanna get any help and i'm glad to get help because i don't wanna feel that way and i wanna get help for the problem instead of doing that  oh gosh there's a lot i regret yeah there's a lot um i regret you know uh drug abuse you know but that's part of you know the p_t_s_d i regret um a lot uh mistakes you know relationships stuff like that  wow um i would've told myself to um i guess the advice i would've given myself was to  try to keep my mind more relaxed i guess yeah um well i'm a very nice person and i always like to smile people are always saying how i smile a lot but um the smile i guess it kind of hides like what's on the inside but you know i'm pretty depressed you know but i just try to keep smiling and i always like to lend a hand to help and make people feel better

373,male,0,9,<synch> yes uh doing okay doing okay uh north carolina yep uh almost four years ago um i graduated college had an internship out here uh for a production company so i started doing that with a group of friends and then got work after that and enjoyed the city so much and have been working out here since yep uh probably three <th> at the most three times a year maybe twice usually the holidays maybe one random trip in there mhm um uh it's l_a's only now just starting to become home to me in the sense of that respect where like uh going home was going home now going home's like going back to see my family and seeing some friends um but um i i feel more i feel more like i belong in los angeles than i do back at home uh the food um the weather goes without saying uh i the <th> i like the resources there i like feeling um i like that uh the things that i wanna do uh are much easier much more accessible out here than they would be in north carolina so it i feel like i'm uh uh i'm able to uh pursue eh a lot of my passions ambitions in a much more functional and realistic way living in los angeles than i am in north carolina uh i mean the cost of living isn't great but at the same time too i always kind of tell people like part of the rent is having access to so much um resources <resour> so many resources out here so uh it's not even expensive as new york or boston so uh it's not the worst but um uh and also i mean it is a little bit annoying that every time i do wanna go home it's a flight not a drive i can't i mean conceivably <con> really conceivably drive home for the holidays 'cause it's about a three or four day adventure and just not practical so it's uh unfortunate that i'm so far away in that respect but i can't really change geography uh <laughter> <laughter> i studied uh history and uh media studies and production uh yes i work as a freelance writer and producer um in college i realized i was pretty good at it and uh i knew there was a way to monetize that and i came out here and uh worked a little bit uh in the uh public sector in trying to you know just doing those jobs that way and realized i could make more money have more control over my schedule and my life if i did it freelance so i've been doing it now for a little over a year now i do um i love traveling i try to uh go somewhere new for a good period of time about every uh seven to eight months just try to mix up things so i was in barcelona just recently and i'm planning on going to um either vietnam or even back to europe in next couple months so mhm uh i enjoy the break from routine i think that uh while it's nice to wake up and kind of have a vague idea where your day's going uh after a few months you can get very much kinda caught up in that and you uh pigeonhole i guess your thought process your expectations for the day and i love going to a foreign country and just waking up and knowing that everything i do that day is gonna be brand new and will be different than what i would be doing if i was in los angeles or and um our own routine so i i'm a big fan of that and i love the food so it's great to just eat um a lot of food that i love in the places where they were originally created uh yeah sure i went to uh barcelona uh like i said a few uh months ago and that was mainly because i had a friend who was living there for uh six or seven months and she kept asking me to come out and uh i finally i was at a point <p> point in work where i'd been working so much for months on end that i felt like i deserved a break so i went there for two weeks and yeah it was one of the healthiest smartest things i've done in awhile so i mm reminded me again how uh how important it is for me at least to uh to travel and to get out of the world i'm very outgoing i uh love talking to people and conversing even virtual people oop i lost ya um to relax i uh listen and play music a lot i like to read uh i like to go see movies uh cook i cook a lot so i enjoy cooking um uh my <m> my girlfriend and i are uh currently separated by distance um so i haven't seen her in weeks and that can be very uh sad obviously so i'll talk with her as much as i can but uh but yeah just uh um uh pretty simple tastes yep <participant is talking to rachel who has entered the room to fix a problem with ellie> <laughter> this is awkward isn't um i don't really have much of a temper so uh very good i guess i don't really get angry easily or quickly and uh when i do i'm usually aware of it enough that i can kinda formulate how i feel and why i'm feeling that way and what i want to be done about it so uh so it's pretty i guess i'm a pretty easygoing guy in that respect <sigh> uh honestly it was probably something petty over like uh misremembering when uh something was done or like a a date on something or like a a a fact probably wasn't anything emotionally fueled uh and it was just about yeah i think it was probably about like trying to figure out when exactly we went to san francisco and it wasn't even an argument as much as just the other person thinking the other person's misremembering so um in you know small or big situation it's very difficult for me to actually feel enraged uh i guess in the classical sense of the word um <sigh> i'm trying to think i'm not one one for regrets um um i just recently did a uh uh a project like a a film and uh the subject matter had a little bit to do with like an ex-girlfriend of mine so when it came time to release it uh i made a point i to i didn't wanna send it to her directly 'cause i didn't want her to think that i was doing to xxx her face but i did send it to her brother just because he enjoys my work and always says he wants to see stuff and i um uh maybe that <tha> she might've could've misconstrued that as being passive-aggressive i don't know um but um but yeah i mean that's something i i thought about but i don't really regret it as much as like maybe i could've just let uh everyone <ever> everyone else who i wouldn't wasn't necessarily sure about if i should do stumble upon it as opposed to me directing it to them so just my thoughts there <sigh> <laughter> hardest decision i've ever had to make <deep breath> ah um <sigh> uh it was actually probably uh probably that uh ah i don't even wasn't even a hard decision with like i said with that the the same ex-girlfriend that i mentioned of it was probably hard because uh i knew i had to uh break up with her after some stuff happened and um it was difficult 'cause i cared about her a great deal but also same tune it wasn't hard to arrive at the conclusion that i had to uh to uh break up with her but at the same time too it was not uh uh the easiest thing to kinda go through that process it's getting on a rollercoaster that you're very much aware of how mm terrible or frightening it's gonna be but you know you have to get on the rollercoaster so uh so yeah i'd say that's probably of recent memory ugh just a abundance of <laughter> reasons that uh this person was probably not the uh best person for me so uh like i said it was a it was i didn't have to uh i didn't have to weigh too much too much data to figure it out um it was pretty clear sign and i have no regrets about doing it now um i uh yeah i feel very strongly then about it and i felt i still feel very strongly that i made the right choice now um <sigh> it can be it can be tough there be <b> they'll be i feel like it's either if i if i've exhausted myself during the day between work and you know i've i've started exercising again which is a huge help but um but i'd say that it's i kind of when i get into bed at night i never know how it's gonna go sometimes it's uh sometimes i'll wake up within an hour of falling asleep and i can't go back to sleep or um i'll just yeah periodically keep getting up and up um so it's something that's gotten a little better in the last few weeks but uh yeah um like i said especially having my uh my current girlfriend uh not around like i said she's a very big source of comfort around so like that uh um but she travels a lot for work so it's something to have to adjust to and uh uh sleep can be can some that suffers from that but uh in the same respect i'm not someone who actually i feel like i don't need too much sleep i if i can get if i can get four to six hours i'm in pretty good shape that day so um uh little anxious i guess uh little more <mo> more just um uh i just whenever i get off of a assignment uh there's always just the question like what am i what's going on next and uh so far i don't have the next um project lined up so it's always that nervousness um in the past something usually does come up so you have the precedent of it usually working out but until it does you're always a little um uh anxious and it can be depressing 'cause it's like uh um you know i've chosen a very much a lifestyle that while i get to have a lot of control and autonomy over my life uh it also is all on me in order to do it and you know sometimes i'm i um i'm very jealous of the idea of people just waking up going to an office for eight hours leaving and not having to think about that work the minute they leave the office and kind of having the momentum of a group of people or or company um carrying them through when um it's a little tough whereas like me if i have an off day or if i'm a sick day um that no work gets done <laughter> you know i'm a small business that has one employee how do i cope with them um i assume you mean i guess uh people i work with how do i cope with the uh maybe the better answer would be how do i cope with that lifestyle and just i got much <m> uh much more used to it something i'm still learning and figuring out how to how to handle uh as far as not just like i know the the how rewarding the work is when i do it but it's also figuring out what's the most efficient way to live the life and you know how do i uh what's the appropriate way to budget finances what's the uh expectation i should have for myself in a given year what's realistic what's hopeful um and that's something that i'm sure will take years and years to do but i feel like as long as i'm getting better at it then uh it's progress right uh yes uh definitely once and then probably i if i would've gone back uh um i was gone in high school probably it would've been second time but um but yeah i've been diagnosed with depression once so i feel like it's one of those things that uh is something i have to keep in check throughout my entire life you know um i feel like i'm a pretty happy person for the most part but um uh has they i hate as annoying as it is but like they say like with people who are very creative or people who do a lot of stuff with the mind it tends to follow and i get that it's a self-esteem thing 'cause it's so hard to feel um so hard <har> or so easy i should <shou> suppose to get in your own head about that uh this was within a year so i probably was feeling uh symptoms having been there before it was kinda easy to figure out like ah you know it's kinda happening again so i feeling uh the symptoms again uh uh and going through those emotions and feeling like okay at first i was kinda hoping it would be something i could kind of work through myself but um i realized it was just stupid for me to try to fight the battle on my own so i went and um started seeing a therapist uh uh really bad this is when i i just couldn't sleep at all like i would get maybe an hour of sleep a night at best um i wasn't sleeping at all had just no <sigh> uh no no drive to do anything whether it was you know as simple as brushing my teeth or cleaning my apartment things like that and just being in the same time simultaneously being aware that it's like oh this is all in my head and it's not even like a a symptom so um uh yeah just a general just a general malaise that comes with depression uh no i just finished up uh finished up i mean since i didn't graduate or anything <anyth> like that but i got to a point where i felt like uh um i kind of talked through as much as i could talk through and i'd moved on eh in other places in my life it was in kind of a good good work xxx especially like i said i was i was working on something i really cared about um i'm now with someone i care about greatly and uh um there's such a potential opportunity for me to not even have to worry about the symptoms and stuff as much now that uh i felt like therapy was not necessary and also i just didn't really have the time to with as much work goes on so oh i definitely i think having someone you can confide in uh who isn't your friend or your family member who won't you know have a few drinks and tell someone what you said to them or anything like that is definitely a a something beneficial i can't imagine how anyone couldn't benefit from having that on a somewhat of a routine basis um <sigh> i don't know i'm i'm a firm <f> kind of a firm believer that the all those things like those things that kinda can haunt you are also there for a reason like uh uh my sister died when i was uh about <bout> what twelve years old and she was younger than me and watching my parents like seeing my father cry for the first time was a very kind of traumatic thing for me and it uh i felt like i grew up a lot that day so it's um also difficult to see that and see how my parents had to deal with losing a child i don't want to forget those things 'cause i think they're very integral to um how i cope with life and how i perceive uh um hardships and obstacles and uh having that image of knowing my father on it's very very humanizing 'cause it's so easy to kind of you idolize your parents and i still idolize my father but to know he's he's a guy like me and as i get older it's um easier identify with uh the man he is <psh> so i'd be uh sixteen or six um uh i kind of like the notion uh that uh they're they always say you wouldn't worry as much what people thought about you if you realized how people how much people didn't think about you and that's really hard to tell a sixteen year old and i don't know what the point of telling a six year old but um but yeah i feel like especially when you're in high school until it gets i mean nowadays you <y> i mean we live in los angeles where so much is caught up in how people think about you and i still am very if i find out someone eh either is upset with me or doesn't like me it bothers me to a great deal or i hate letting people down so i would like to come to a healthier place where just knowing that sometimes you just can't really control how people feel about you even if you have the best intentions in the world so uh i'm a very compassionate guy i um i'm there for my friends i'm pretty selfless in that respect i um have a good humor about things like even with <laughter> even with being depressed or depression i can joke about it it's not you know i'm not a morbid depressed more just the i'm aware of when i'm uh i'm low and uh i treat it as such and i don't you know i don't try to deny it i don't try to like any of that but i i i have a i'm a i'm a pretty like practical person in that respect i don't think uh even when i'm depressed i don't take it out on people or i don't think people people have told me they don't even seem to when i mention that <cough> been going through like depression no one seems to like or they don't mention i for one feel like when i do go through it it's like oh everyone can just tell and i'm just a smoking gun of sadness basically <laughter> but uh but no i i tend to carry it pretty well and uh um i don't i don't lose sight of uh the reality <rea> the reality of what i know is happening so mm um i was on a my uh my girlfriend came uh she was in thailand for three weeks and then she was supposed to go to spain for two but she canceled that trip and came back and stayed with me for about ten days and um yeah i know i <laughter> i love her she's great um she's the coolest person i know and so much fun and she uh when she's around she makes me so happy and uh um so having her for ten days and we just had like normal we we rarely get normal couples time like it's always like oh i see you for five days and then one of us has to go somewhere um so to have ten days just normal where we could just cook dinner at home like lie in bed and read books or anything like that was great and uh it makes me so happy that i have someone that i can do that with and just it feels so uh practical and feels so right um <sigh> i guess for xxx i'm i'm i'm a good guy like i i i know i don't uh i don't think i screw people over i don't um i'm a good friend to have i'm i'm there for people i look out for people i care uh about people and what they think of me and that goes especially much for my friends and i try to make sure you know with a lot of my friends being on the east coast i try to carve out time to make sure that they know i think about them and i call them and so i i feel like uh for a lot of people who count me as their friend i'm probably one of their better ones in just the sense that i'm i know how much i appreciate and respect uh the friendships we have thanks ellie bye

608,male,0,2,"today at 1  so you're going to see everybody  okay  yes  I'm so young  I'm second  San Bernardino California  the weather is nice  will still like about La it's very sunny  I like the people here  I don't like how it's spread out it is and  how long was that I don't like the the lack of public transportation  and I don't like that everything shuts down at 2 a.m.  introverts yes I do  why  because I tend to be very stoic I don't tend to  I don't know express myself so much and I tend to be very reserved and not  really forthcoming about my feelings Etc  I'm not sure I understand the question exactly but  I can't really say I just I just Retreat Within Myself and I don't  tend to express what I'm thinking or feeling  that makes sense  I'm second  second place  what the  whipping  what do I do when I'm alone bicycle locks  yeah right by school like very like everywhere I'm a bicycle commuter and I also like and I'll read a lot  I'm very good at controlling my temper I don't  I mean I'm so good at repressing repressing my feelings are that my very really Express I mean I don't know I don't really Express anger or else I don't really feel anger because  I'm not an angry person I may be very disappointed at when something bad happens but that won't erupt in a in a rage I don't feel I don't really feel Rachel but I know I'm so exposed to it all the time on the road I see people like me at all yelling at each other and screaming has so it's yeah I totally cultivate my serenity  what time I argue with someone  which would have been the job-related arguments and  now what I said in school  I started English  American literature  currently unemployed then was my most recent job was at as a as a tutor and before that I've been a grant writer payroll Clerk  I've had like an assortment of jobs  yeah I agree I agree  what's my dream job  I'd like to be an editor I'd like to  like I'd Publications  or like right stories for Publications I feel more comfortable being another Direction more comfortable like working with Pros done with I guess I producing my own. So I like to be like another applications editor  yeah  travel a lot  I'd like to travel I've tried before  one of those memorable experiences I  I'm pretty close to my family back out here to be closer to them about 2 years ago from Chicago and so I'm closer to them now, but I don't know it was kind of a mistake professionally cuz I haven't been able to get anything going out here and so I probably should have stayed in Chicago  I'm sick and I'm sorry I don't really understand  I'm pretty well Chicago it was fun over there was working as a grant writer and we're there for grad school but either dropping out of grad school but the finding work has been over 5 years I like it alot  Mallory situation I'm okay with it right now I'm living with a relative it's  it could be better but right now is like right now but employed and it's like I said anything to me stay rent-free and so I'm okay right now before I'm at but I really do need to find another job so I can  I get myself stabilized  yeah I'm living with my uncle and  you know like I say at this place and so  he's kind of eccentric  I don't know how subscribe them he's pretty out there but anyway he's okay guy  do I have a source of what  I'm sorry do I have  I can really barely hear what you're saying and it's hard for me to understand you sometimes but I'll wait for you to answer me or ask me a question  no I haven't  no I haven't but I've  awesome felt oppressed  but I never had a diagnosis of depression  I've been feeling good lately I mean relatively I mean  I prefer being unemployed and feeling like really angsty over that that's  you know I'm in a position where I can you know you know I can't sort of like survive out here which is important and  and I'm not homeless which is important so I feel okay I mean yeah I could be doing a lot better on the other hand I'm not on the streets and things could be much worse  no I haven't  I'm not sure what the question was if I'd like to send some kind of therapy  I've been in therapy before but it hasn't  I don't know I was supposed to be there people like the therapist and I wasn't like really  it didn't really help me out so much like a slight work at my issues but I enjoy talking to a therapist and I guess that's kind of like a pair of the whole situation to to the scenario talking to a virtual human that you just have someone to sit with for a while he will listen to you it someday I could be very soothing Melody  I feel that way often well do I feel like I need to talk to someone very often  sometimes I mean yeah I do like repressed emotions like man the pretty much I assumed I could ever become black holes with someone I would have someone I can share my thoughts and feelings with butts  I was like I guess you can say I do feel what's the word I feel lonely but not lonely but like for a self contained within  what's the word within my own sort of sense of self my own feelings and I don't really  have a need to reach out as much because  I'm a practice God I practice meditation and I totally totally helps me like next to retreat into myself in lights are like fine fine serenity serenity through a lack of desire and soap that helps me with  I mean I guess I could loneliness but also I mean maybe it was like you know it like a problem I actually don't reach out to people as often as I should but I definitely neglected relationships because of that  and it may all be as like self-centeredness you know but  I'm trying to oh yeah this is a good one I want to try to find a way to Lake engage with people without like really  allowing myself to let them down so to speak and so that is  one of the things that inhibits me from reaching out to people is the idea that I could that I could potentially let them down if they were to place their faith in me or the trust in me and so I'm very reluctant to do that  go on  how easy it is for me I don't really again I'm only hearing part part of what you're saying and so  this is going to throw off my answer  I would say it's very easy I mean I can't really like I don't understand the question for Quan  what I'm I think I said it would only was afraid of probably most afraid of  oh my God being a failure or not being a success finding a stable job  not being able to  I mean settle down and essentially ain't getting married  it's um I don't know I am okay with being single I'm not okay with being jobless  I'm so it's like one of those things that's just like  I just I don't feel I can reach out to people so because I don't have a job and so I got to like bring them into my mic my life so right right now I'm not in position to like a people I mean  they have a lot of friends with us because I can't like really go outside and they can so you know spend money at  and restaurants or in clubs or whatever  so I'm going to buy to a lots and I think a lot so I meditate a lots and I read a lot of literature  I want to go to my felt really happy  well just last weekend that was set my  my aunt and uncle's 50th one of your anniversary and it was a nice occasion it was really it was not their whole family was there are friendly was there and  like my own parents 50th anniversary is coming up 50/50 years together and  I felt really happy for them I felt really happy that I got both of them and provided us with like a really  a really great childhood and  it seems strange I guess I put that kind of starting point but that's something I mean I guess like suit to be floundering right now but I feel happy for the  I think I guess locations like that are probably could become rarer on his light on a societal level but that some sort of like Beyond Leon sort of like Realm of happiness and anyway this weekend. I'm on the road on a bicycle and going pretty fast  how are your best friends  my best friend  actually  she would describe me as depressed all the time and I asked her about this and he's like I swear if it being around me I had brought her down at all because she was going through her own like for a deep depression that I was kind of trying to coax her out of that but it sometimes myself and so  I asked her if you're around me brought her down at all and she said no it's it made her that I had liked it but I take an interest in her but  what's the word let's would like my sort of like my depression wasn't like really the net didn't have anything to do with her depression it was completely unrelated to like how I felt and feel like I don't know in both cases it was just good to have someone else to be around who had some respect for  like it's like how we felt or like alarm useful sort of like lack of feeling and I can put it that way and so has being brave I seem very depressed all the time and she's my best friend  at this moment  anything I regret  all right  thank you  goodbye  hello and goodbye  hello  it was kind of interesting as like I should have like told you I had like my ears are kind of kind of clogged and so I had trouble like during her at some at some point"
426,male,1,20,<sync. yes i'm alright south l_a um the weather the women the opportunities that's about it racism police brutality injustice that's it mm no not much of a exploring type of person um psychology mhm um it was one of the classes i excelled in the most so i decided to change it from business to psychology yeah yes no to own my own record label um it it's moderately hard but you know take it one day at a time just i guess you know stay focused a little bit of both um i tend to be shy in um situations i'm not comfortable with or i'm new to and i'm outgoing in places i'm more comfortable with yeah <laughter> um turn the lights down low and listen to soft music mhm i'm getting better over the years um i think i'm pretty decent now compared to how i used to be yes ma'am um due to the lack of i guess you could say controlling my emotions i have uh gotten incarcerated sent to prison yeah mm i'm not sure uh i don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision i've made in my life um it was probably a few days ago with the girl i was talking to and i was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness yeah uh frustrated because um you know uh you you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect you know the same effort by the other person when you're in a relationship and at the same time when you when you have expectations sometimes you kinda set yourself up for failure so you know i guess i'm just learning there's a lot of situations i would've handled differently um probably the most recent was uh i had gotten into a physical <phy> a physical altercation with an inmate when i was incarcerated and that made me that's what sent me to prison and and i had to do a lot more time and um if i handled it differently i probably would've never went to prison i probably would've been home a lot sooner than i originally happen yeah mm there are several events i wish i could erase from my memory um probably uh my first girlfriend um she did something really uh extreme it wasn't necessary in my eyes and it and it cost <co> it could've cost me my life i think that that that's a recurring thought that i i wish i could completely erase from my memory along with the good memories as well um a few you few fights uh i guess you could say shoot outs um getting jumped getting robbed you know those things i think those inhibit me i guess to to explore certain areas of life that i'm not comfortable with so those are the feww things that it'd be nice if i could erase it completely yeah <sigh> hurting people that didn't need to be hurt emotionally especially um a few women in my life or in my past um probably putting my mother through certain things that she didn't have to go through along with my close friends and family as well um used to be rocky growing up but as i got older and matured and the certain experiences that i've been through kind of brought me closer to my family so now it's it it's pretty decent it's it's pretty decent mm i would say my mother um yeah my mother um well she she uh she had her share of experiences negative and positive um i admire her the struggles she's been through um she she she uh experienced difficult economic hardships growing up but that didn't stop her um from raising a son at a young age finishing school getting her master's and just just overall being a a good person and she also battled mental health issues as well and um probably not the best of family that she could've been raised with so she so she's kinda of like a a inspiration to to me and other people as well so i would say my mother mm it's not easy so yeah it's not easy i couldn't tell you i i i've always had sleeping issues um i usually just take uh like over the counter sleep medication or nyquil but it makes you drowsy the next morning so it's like it's a negative effect really yeah the medication <medi> i don't know shit i don't know but i just stopped taking it 'cause i didn't like feeling drowsy not good at all um yeah i mean i recently got released from prison not too long ago uh i'm older now and a lot more responsibilities and i feel like my life is not where it's supposed to be i feel like i could've made a lot more better decisions in my life you know sometimes feeling sorry for myself and just things that i've been through and the whole nine yards so yeah it's all good yeah so true yes <sniffle> about two and a half three years ago <deep breath> <sigh> myself i um i was i was just tired of not i don't know i guess school kind of made me seek help because i started to understand myself how my brain works um you know so i decided to seek help maybe to better my life yeah you could say that yes i am yes yes i do actually i do mm better decision making um better tools to reflect on choices um how to control uh certain situations better yeah um <sniffle> well instead of just always reacting on emotion no matter what kind of emotion it is i step back and and and i assess the situation you know to see what's what's the best way to to react towards the situation and by doing that it has made me more mature emotionally more mature and just has a positive outcome <laughter> um i was lying next to a beautiful woman who who cared about me and the feeling was mutual so that was probably the most happy oh my goodness spontaneous um outgoing sometimes a little crazy um fun that's about it nothing um like i said earlier just you know hurting the the few women that were in my life my past and my friends and family that's about it oh shit uh school is really important um how i carry myself the people who i surround myself with and what i choose to do in my free time those are the few things i would tell myself good music um a good game of basketball um sex um i like going out i like going to parties um social gatherings where everyone's friendly and and there's no drama that's what i like dancing beautiful women a couple drinks that's about it um i guess not not necessarily giving up and and um just just i don't know just keep going just just not giving up really yeah mhm bye bye
414,female,1,16,hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today  created to talk to people in space  and please  are you okay with this  yeah  how are you doing today  I'm okay  Burbank California  yeah  the weather of course I think everyone likes the weather  it's not too  City like Chicago or New York it's a big enough we have beaches we're not landlocked  sometimes the smog the traffic the fact that I've just been here like my entire life almost  okay  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer  do you travel a lot  not enough as I'd like to I go to school in Chicago and I've been to New York a couple times San Francisco and I took a road trip across the country that was cool I saw a couple States  what do you enjoy about traveling  see new places  going to Landmark that I've only  read about ER theme pictures of  I traveled from Los Angeles to Chicago taking Route 66 and the best part was seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time it was  the coolest thing I've ever seen probably  happy  and then Happy was as beautiful it was nice  I haven't felt like that in a long time  I'm studying film  it's just  something I've always loved for as long as I could remember and when it came time to start applying to schools I wasn't sure what I wanted to do and I apply to Northwestern as a film student and it just ended up being the right decision  dream job  I love making movies but part of me really loves making people laugh and being in front of the camera so  comedian I'm coming a comedic actor would be totally great but  you consider yourself more shy or  I am super outgoing and I love talking to people a lot I like I like being the center of attention usually  hey  but it's the best I've got  I  I like to watch mindless television like Toddlers & Tiaras and Duck Dynasty just TV programs were really don't have to pay attention at all  okay  how are you at controlling your temper  I'm okay at it I get really emotional really fast but I am usually able to use to keep my anger down and not like lash out at others and stuff for the most part  sometimes I get into like arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily  and I hate apologizing to people so besides could last pretty long  my best friend Ryan I think  and it was about  our relationship and just how we kind of messed it up and cross some lines and  where how we were going to go back to the way it was before  how hard is that  really hard it's he's my best friend and I miss him  but we messed up and this is just not the same  it's like not the same friendship  me too  too many  I guess  when I have a boyfriend and he has a girlfriend because not okay I wish I would have just  realize that this was bad and just would have stopped there and not have let it continue 4 weeks which led to my break up and then our friendship being really messed up  I guess not spend as much time with him as I did  be more assertive  I guess  it was  in November  I was very depressed and suicidal  so I told my friend what I was feeling and that she needed to take me to the ER  and from the ER I have the choice to  I don't know I guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital  and even though I felt like I didn't have a choice I knew it was my choice and I decided to go to the mental hospital which is like the worst experience of my life ever  it was awful it was in Chicago and  it was scary and I didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just  start giving you medication and you're basically left to your own devices they were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was mostly men and they were all really old and it was scary I didn't know anyone everyone most of the people there weren't depressed they were violent so that was pretty scary and I just dumb it was really hard for me  I had been so depressed for like a month I stopped going to my classes and work and I told my teachers lies about being sick and I just kept calling in sick to work I dropped a class and I was failing my classes and not turned in any work and I wasn't talking to any of my friends and I was drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and  I was just in a really bad place and when I finally was going to kill myself I realized I needed help  it was  I had severe depression when I was a younger teenager and I tried to kill myself then and I got put in therapy for quite some time so I figured I don't want to go down that bad path again I just want to get better  so I had to do it I had to get help  I do I go once a week  I feel like if you have the right therapist it's really useful  I had one therapist that I really liked and I thought we could have gone really far but sadly she's back in Chicago and I'm in Los Angeles so I have to  have to make do with this new therapist and she's okay  just not we're not that great together but she's who I have right now  better than nothing  not that easy at all  ever since I got out of the hospital and start a night began medication for my depression  just haven't been able to sleep well falling asleep is hard staying asleep is hired have really crazy vivid dreams that wake me up in are disturbing  like what  I guess just  sometimes they reflect things that I'm worried about are happening in my life but they're just  the scary and they seem so real that sometimes I wake up and I have to ask my mom like did we go here to be do this to this really happen and it's usually know you dreamed that sometimes I've gotten so scared I like talk in my sleep and wake myself up  probably like two nights ago  wow  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  that is a  hard question  I think  and November  after I got out of the hospital  I finally had one good day and my friend took me into downtown Chicago and we went to the Sears Tower and got to look over those like big windows that you walk out on and see the city and that was with the cool  how your best friend  probably  super outgoing likes to be the center of attention funny and a little bit crazy  I try not to regret things in my life  I would say that living is worth it and just don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it don't wait until it gets really bad  I guess my ideal weekend would be sleeping in and then catching a movie with my friends may be going home with them and bake some cookies eat all the cookies watch some TV have a sleepover and then like make pancakes in the morning and watch more movies we watch a lot of movies I would like to do my free time  go for a walk I don't know go to the beach  that is a hard question I mean I think I've done a lot of great things in my life  and I have achieved a lot but  I think one of the proudest things badass moments in my life is something really small and insignificant I was doing this exercise boot camp and  the last persons like cross the finish line had to do like  30 pushups and it was some guy I didn't really know him at all and the trainer said does anyone want to help him if he's going to help them you have to do half each and no one wanted to help him and then I just decided to start doing push ups with him and I just  it wasn't cuz I wanted to get creditor because I thought it would make me look good I just did it and no one really knows about that but it's just I feel really good about that  is my Buy  press the button

453,male,1,17,hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today yes  Los Angeles  convenience convenience  people the crowd  traffic  people that lack of respect  locally originally  meeting old people I love talking old people  I work a lot with my elders in my reservation and other reservations here in California and I spend a lot of time with her with the elders I talked with them and they helped me out of  Target are good stories  going in the mountains and seeing waterfalls then no one else is saying except for my people and I was the most beautiful thing I think I found  it depends on the situation if I'm if somebody comes to me looking for me to help them I take control it if I need help with its I work at asking for help so it depends on the situation  I Garden  and I think  very good.  3 days ago it was about communication and the lack of communication on the other person's part and I needed them to communicate better so that way I could understand and they didn't communicate so we had an argument and I got to settle  I felt I'm caught off guard because this is an individual that I spend pretty much almost every minute of my day with and to not be told what was going on in this person's head and then to have a situation arise and I was kept out I didn't like that  I got a pass  probably lack of time spent with my grandparents  just wanted on you regret that you didn't miss time with spend time with me  I want thing I truly wish I could remember I was I was a professional athlete and what time I have party till like 4 in the morning and then I had did my event at like 10 in the morning and I was my captain and I'm very smile team  that's one thing I truly believe that  are the professional fighter soon  yeah I'm not party. About other people besides myself  I studied massage therapy and Nursing degree  a lot of it's just been on job education  I'm very  I'll get to my own injuries I just going through the therapy process and believing in people and seeing how it worked and I decided to do that I wanted to help people too  are you happy  oh yeah  yes  I want to paint that's all I want to do is just paint  I have two sons and it's time for me to the move on and they're older and they can take care of themselves now so many leaving the area where my sons are sweetheart  the reflection of you  play reflection of you a mind you so much about yourself Who You Are  consistency even when you're sick  I don't assume my kids are right around by listen to him first and then make my decisions after that and I try not to come from an emotional hiding place but I think logically and I put myself in their place before I do it we discuss we communicate happy in my family cuz that's the only way we get along with each other through communication  communicate  my family is severed pretty much so my family my relationship with my family on the reservation is very tight and the rest of the family were all fragmented scattered around the Southwest so it's not very tight at all  I have too many to count  start with my uncle my uncle was like my dad. Me to go away  he watched out for me he told me he taught me hard work at a very young age he also taught me to protect my family  Tommy honor. Me Love  it's a good man  how easy is it for you to get a good night  I don't lie ever had a good night sleep in years so I have to get broken sleep  are dreams the dreams you come through real  get up and go to the bathroom and go back to sleep  my years of fighting and just got up to me  reserved  reserved and I try to find things to distract my brain to think of different ways of doing things  I got rid of TV about 8 months ago so I got rid of that distraction so what I do now is ready to paint a garden or cleaning house washing dishes or get out the walk that's nothing to do a lot of walking out is  anxiety anxious  my anxieties  habits good I have techniques to bring myself down  nothing new  out of the normal  yes  3 years ago around 3  insomnia issues  it was about  2 years ago around there to look it over two years ago I was released from therapy  off the therapist Release Me  what I noticed is I still deal with pictures and emotions  what would I do is now if I really practice hard at taking care of myself and then getting to those places to things that  strike me give me anxious or excited or angry I learn how to work out of it and realize it's not real it's not real  that's just the emotion it's not real so these are the things like no manches and I tell myself and this is really helped me a lot from therapy because it taught me that those emotions and pictures truly aren't real  and that's the therapies helped a lot that mean it's just a change my world  if  around the same time as the PTSD  after years ago  in my dreams when I dream I do  last night  I just dreaming of fighting and then in preparing fighters to fight I wasn't nothing to I build up anxiety dreaming about preparing fighters to fight and then stepping in front of thousands of people and then I always end up fighting in my dreams so it's always what gets me scared in all my dreams is that I should have made the move and finish the fight and I didn't  and so builds anxiety and stressing me that I tend to act out in my sleep  I was real like I was there right like I smell taste feel everything their house there  on this morning driving here talking to my girlfriend  trustworthy  he loves me I love him he's more best friends  a 02 change  I can recall  okay  I got it  just not spending time with my grandparents and in  I think they today issues maybe you know a couple here there that I should have went to the store first or something like that but I mean it's nothing like that  quit thinking you know it all  my loyalty  my trustworthiness  the new art project yesterday  nice  where is Santa Barbara from the film some rocks and some old rock song Someone that made by loving just threw a dump old rocks out of the way and it went through the pile of rocks and I found the soul rock that was in the middle of it and then took a home and now I'm doing art piece on it and for me it was like the thing was totally forgotten about was just considered a rock and now they're sure you'll be sitting in my grand kids table and let's just give me a call like that  what are you most proud of in your life  start starting something that I'm so bad at  then I don't think there's no way I can be good at it and all sudden I get to be better at it so I don't even have to think about it just so good at it that way I could just touch it and feel it and then I think about it these are the things I'm proud of like I like that I like that  accomplishment I guess you can say  her her left clavicle needs adjustment  her clavicle set tired makes it look like she's been in a car accident and she's like this sheet her left shoulder is up higher and it's question so you're off and it's drawing my attention to that so I don't know if you guys noticed that to the other part of it too is the hand motions that she does some of the hand motions are very aggressive in it and wakes it was very distracting in the beginning because she was like  fast moving like my therapist cuz we working with the PTSD issues he that he did everything slowly cuz I said off on quick trigger movements and so like with her hand movements like that. Like this talkin it was distracting in the beginning but besides that everything is just like it's pretty amazing computer but it's and you feel comfortable that is a good thing  yeah yeah
341,female,0,7,sure i'm doing fine just a little tired california yes um the weather <laughter> not last week but yeah the weather <laughter> fear of earthquakes psychology i am i go to harbor college i am um wish i would've went sooner but better late than never probably i'm not sure i haven't really thought about it i wanna work in the field of psychology but i'm not sure if i wanna work with children or adults so i haven't really decided  no <laughter> i don't know i just don't maybe once a year um june actually i went to uh orlando florida sometimes yeah not as i'm sorry um watch t_v read a book talk on the phone mhm mad mm <sigh> my mom gets in my business <laughter> other than that um i guess just frustrations with my son no <laughter> um the hardest thing is um raising a child with a disability not knowing how you can help him it is it's very hard i don't sugarcoat it at all just having my children they're a blessing i love 'em <laughter> with all the good and the bad it's a part of me and i just love the fact that i'm helping mold them into  good human beings <laughter> we're really close i mean my family's small we live within blocks of each other but yeah we're close  good or bad <laughter> most memorable just giving birth for the first time it was just amazing my son is nine now so i still remember it like it was yesterday <laughter> like i was being born again myself i don't know how to explain it it just very emotional <laughter> i don't know <laughter> i guess i have a lot of regrets but none that i really wanna mention i guess <laughter> stay in school <laughter> don't get emotionally involved and um let people deter you from your goals <laughter> oh yeah definitely did you wanna move on i'm okay i mean i'm pretty easygoing  for the most part i don't really have a temper per se things frustrate me more than they anger me xxx oh that's easy <laughter> with my mother she's like um i guess the argument stemmed from me wanting to socialize <laughter> she feels that i'm married with children so i should stay at home like ninety nine percent of the time and i wanted to go out and socialize with some ex co-workers and she basically kinda put me down for it as if i don't spend enough time with my children <laughter>  it does and i love my mom i hate even having the thoughts of being frustrated with her because i always think gosh i don't wanna get mad at her and then something happens to her the next day but she gets kinda intrusive <laughter> i don't know <laughter> oh i know um after the semester ended when i noted that i  you know i did well in school 'cause i had been it had been a long time since i went to school so when i received my grades you know a and a b i was like wow okay i can do this and it made me happy and that was about a few weeks ago i guess mhm thank you my mom i know it's good and bad <laughter> i mean for the most part my mom's been a positive influence you know it's just sometimes you know she gets a little like she wants to re-raise me or something like she doesn't understand that i'm an adult i'm gonna make my own decisions now and  pretty much have to let me do what i need to do <sigh> a lotta  heavy breathing <laughter> i mean i walk sometimes when i get a lil' frustrated whatever i'll just go take a walk you know or um just try not to think about it thank you <laughter> yes yes the navy i was nineteen yeah <laughter> yeah i didn't have any other options <laughter> i am i probably should've stayed in a lil' longer i was only in for four years but  you know i wanted to experience life outside the military so i did my enlistment and then i got out it made me a little bit more responsible than some of my friends that you know did not join the military i can notice a big difference as far as you know how i live my life and how they live theirs um just made me a little bit more responsible thank you <laughter> i worked in the medical field for about five years and uh oh thank you <laughter> but um it wasn't for me i wanted to do something lil' bit different i didn't wanna do patient care i wanted to work with people but not necessarily as a patient care provider so i started going to school and then i met my husband i stopped going to school got married and i started working in a telecommunications field and then we you know conceived our child and after that you know <laughter> <laughter> i think i'm caring well i know i am i'm very caring you know i'm very honest  to a fault sometimes you know i try to be as honest as possible with people sometimes it can hurt their feelings but you know you gotta be honest you can't let people think that you know you're not trusting and if mm yeah probably i don't i never really thought about it i don't know <laughter> maybe i don't really think about it i just try to be the best person that i can be you know so all i can do i can't live for what other people think i can only do what i need to do <laughter>  um i don't know <laughter> i never really thought about it  i guess it just you know being around my kids you know i just love being around my children and that's always puts me in a good mood <laughter> thank you okay like i said a lil' tired you know but you know for the most part okay you know i'm dealing with situations that well i go to bed really early so long as i go to bed early i get a good night's sleep but i wake up early as well so <laughter> it's kinda like good and bad a lil' bit i go to bed like eight eight thirty and then i wake up at like one one thirty so <laughter> very moody very irritable short short-tempered i guess if anything i think i'm thinking more positively you know like i said especially with my son having a disability you know i i look at it as if you know it's not all bad i mean he has challenges eh but i'm dealing with them a lot better you know as opposed to feeling sorry for him or feeling sorry for myself you know i'm just finding more avenues to work with him you know different resources to help him as opposed to just feeling guilty or sad and depressed about it thank you no occasionally who doesn't <laughter> i don't know can

334,male,0,5,Usher  if I have to  I can see I mean I don't know exactly her face but I can see that's a woman  okay  okay  yes  I got a little tired  Seattle Washington  oh and I was 18 my mom and dad decide we want to move to California and so we move down to Pasadena to Monrovia first and I've been here ever since  yeah  I did about two years ago I went up for work and look around the area  pretty easy actually I do adapt  a warm weather not having rain tonight month of the year  people may lie  the the area how big it is a traffic  my first got here is a smog as better now  know when I was younger I was but I got out at work I did  sure why I became when I have my mom died and I need work I went for a job that was called petitioning and you have to go in front of stores and talk to people about signing petitions and you do that after awhile you don't get shy about talking to anybody also when I was in school I took public speaking and I learned that I really liked it more than I thought I would  so I so I did the census job I actually got four front of groups of people and talk to them and show them how to take the test and I enjoyed it  right now I'm working on getting all my licenses for selling insurance  and I'm going to start work out trying to get money from people to help kids and the and the world  all the one the job helping kids was also a paid job I need a paid job the one for insurance cuz I was getting older and I need work that was steady and that's something I can do it on 85 or 90 or whatever  to be an artist  I always been good with art I like drawing painting excetra but I didn't know if I could ever make a living out so I never really got into it and every time I tried it seems I never got anywhere so maybe when I get like 80 or 90 mail going to the Ceramics or something to do that as a profession  no unfortunately.  That's okay  I'm not my mom and dad or die are dead I have no brothers or sisters and the rest of my family have either moved away or I don't talk to him anymore or like that  I've have an attitude if I have me and friends I have and I'm okay  I read  watch Parts when they're available  I say I used to play golf I may do that again someday but not right now because of the cost and the time  people that rude  are usually ignored this morning actually I told a guy to stop what he's doing and we got kind of an argument about and then the argument is over and it was done  very good because I had a very bad temper I was a kid and I told myself I had to control it  August morning about the guy making lots and lots of noise on purpose and in a place that was just not the place to do it I mean it was a public place but  and I was in just a little argument and I'm done with the Army once I say what I say  yeah  not right now I can think of  oh I read  if I can travel I travel I don't travel long distances but even going out to Riverside is having adventure for me  seeing things on the way and back talk in the people maybe  well known for years ago I want rolled back he's to Massachusetts to do work back there on the way back I took a Greyhound bus all the way back from Washington DC see all the way back to California and the washing on 1st and I'm down from there and work in Massachusetts for a bottle at 6 months to 8 Mile and joy the area quite a bit but don't want to be there when the snow came  and  enjoy coming back on the bus had people next to me almost all the way different people and a lot of fun  yeah  yeah I was in the Air Force and when I was 18 1965 during the Vietnam war  no I was in Great Falls Montana  and I really don't know yours later I probably learned more from the fact that I got out early and maybe I should have stayed in and stuck with it as younger and so now that and other things aside never quit anything  I came down here play pool for number years find a graduate from high school which I dropped out of when I moved went on the college got my bachelor's degree and an AA degree in Pasadena and Cal State LA and start working various jobs and that's about it took care of my mom  a business was my major I also studied things like anthropology and philosophy and history excetera  no  no never do  lately not so good between the fact I sleep in my car and it's very cold and that sometimes I do get and with all the things going on in my life right now as I think of things can solve and plus I get up at 4:30 in the morning  that's okay  I tired  and I got a little grumpy sometimes but not very much  tired with all the things I've had to do and the weather and the sleep  no  a little bit sometimes about how maybe I should start doing all this years ago  I just go on I tell myself to basically stop it and go on doing what things to improve myself  not very anymore took me years to study dad to do that  I don't know if you called Xander not bud  a couple months ago and I passed all my tests and Medicare Advantage  passed every one of them for every come in and send them to me  I expect everything I do now on persistent  I don't let things get out of hand before I do something about it  I used to be what's the word I put off things I don't do that anymore  hand  I treat people nicely always until given a reason not to  and I don't talk about my bad stuff to anybody usually  not very because the same thing I've trained myself over the years that not talk about myself I talk to other people talk about them  how I said my mother  Gabby  Bertrand Russell  I'm not sure who else other people I've had that I don't remember their names or they were teachers excetera  early in life I like I said I stopping everything not completing things that I regret very much  oh yeah I could have done better  probably device I gave myself to get off my butt and go learn get an education and get all of my life and do something  dog survive  tell me about  well I'm 65  I've been sleeping in my car for a number of years I went from sleeping on pavement or I got a car lot done that improve my credit rating I've got a number of jobs I've been very happy with I have had a lot of friends both all people that are homeless and on Alma's  Handa  have a pretty good health  how are the other people in my family have died young  so I guess that's about it  good jokes  people having a happy time  going to having a drink with somebody on occasional basis  how about eight months ago was last time when I had a beer with someone  I say  probably  can I wasn't one foot of a live wild deer  I was in a green Lake and Washington  and I was out behind your house and that's wild buck deer was walking in the field and I started motion into it and came of them out one foot of me and the only reason I left my dad drove down the driveway and it made a noise and the deer ran off how is with embedding difference distance of them and I wasn't too sure if I should have had them or not but I was about to  I do  why  she's pretty cool for a knot  okay

414,female,1,16,hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today  created to talk to people in space  and please  are you okay with this  yeah  how are you doing today  I'm okay  Burbank California  yeah  the weather of course I think everyone likes the weather  it's not too  City like Chicago or New York it's a big enough we have beaches we're not landlocked  sometimes the smog the traffic the fact that I've just been here like my entire life almost  okay  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer  do you travel a lot  not enough as I'd like to I go to school in Chicago and I've been to New York a couple times San Francisco and I took a road trip across the country that was cool I saw a couple States  what do you enjoy about traveling  see new places  going to Landmark that I've only  read about ER theme pictures of  I traveled from Los Angeles to Chicago taking Route 66 and the best part was seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time it was  the coolest thing I've ever seen probably  happy  and then Happy was as beautiful it was nice  I haven't felt like that in a long time  I'm studying film  it's just  something I've always loved for as long as I could remember and when it came time to start applying to schools I wasn't sure what I wanted to do and I apply to Northwestern as a film student and it just ended up being the right decision  dream job  I love making movies but part of me really loves making people laugh and being in front of the camera so  comedian I'm coming a comedic actor would be totally great but  you consider yourself more shy or  I am super outgoing and I love talking to people a lot I like I like being the center of attention usually  hey  but it's the best I've got  I  I like to watch mindless television like Toddlers & Tiaras and Duck Dynasty just TV programs were really don't have to pay attention at all  okay  how are you at controlling your temper  I'm okay at it I get really emotional really fast but I am usually able to use to keep my anger down and not like lash out at others and stuff for the most part  sometimes I get into like arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily  and I hate apologizing to people so besides could last pretty long  my best friend Ryan I think  and it was about  our relationship and just how we kind of messed it up and cross some lines and  where how we were going to go back to the way it was before  how hard is that  really hard it's he's my best friend and I miss him  but we messed up and this is just not the same  it's like not the same friendship  me too  too many  I guess  when I have a boyfriend and he has a girlfriend because not okay I wish I would have just  realize that this was bad and just would have stopped there and not have let it continue 4 weeks which led to my break up and then our friendship being really messed up  I guess not spend as much time with him as I did  be more assertive  I guess  it was  in November  I was very depressed and suicidal  so I told my friend what I was feeling and that she needed to take me to the ER  and from the ER I have the choice to  I don't know I guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital  and even though I felt like I didn't have a choice I knew it was my choice and I decided to go to the mental hospital which is like the worst experience of my life ever  it was awful it was in Chicago and  it was scary and I didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just  start giving you medication and you're basically left to your own devices they were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was mostly men and they were all really old and it was scary I didn't know anyone everyone most of the people there weren't depressed they were violent so that was pretty scary and I just dumb it was really hard for me  I had been so depressed for like a month I stopped going to my classes and work and I told my teachers lies about being sick and I just kept calling in sick to work I dropped a class and I was failing my classes and not turned in any work and I wasn't talking to any of my friends and I was drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and  I was just in a really bad place and when I finally was going to kill myself I realized I needed help  it was  I had severe depression when I was a younger teenager and I tried to kill myself then and I got put in therapy for quite some time so I figured I don't want to go down that bad path again I just want to get better  so I had to do it I had to get help  I do I go once a week  I feel like if you have the right therapist it's really useful  I had one therapist that I really liked and I thought we could have gone really far but sadly she's back in Chicago and I'm in Los Angeles so I have to  have to make do with this new therapist and she's okay  just not we're not that great together but she's who I have right now  better than nothing  not that easy at all  ever since I got out of the hospital and start a night began medication for my depression  just haven't been able to sleep well falling asleep is hard staying asleep is hired have really crazy vivid dreams that wake me up in are disturbing  like what  I guess just  sometimes they reflect things that I'm worried about are happening in my life but they're just  the scary and they seem so real that sometimes I wake up and I have to ask my mom like did we go here to be do this to this really happen and it's usually know you dreamed that sometimes I've gotten so scared I like talk in my sleep and wake myself up  probably like two nights ago  wow  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  that is a  hard question  I think  and November  after I got out of the hospital  I finally had one good day and my friend took me into downtown Chicago and we went to the Sears Tower and got to look over those like big windows that you walk out on and see the city and that was with the cool  how your best friend  probably  super outgoing likes to be the center of attention funny and a little bit crazy  I try not to regret things in my life  I would say that living is worth it and just don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it don't wait until it gets really bad  I guess my ideal weekend would be sleeping in and then catching a movie with my friends may be going home with them and bake some cookies eat all the cookies watch some TV have a sleepover and then like make pancakes in the morning and watch more movies we watch a lot of movies I would like to do my free time  go for a walk I don't know go to the beach  that is a hard question I mean I think I've done a lot of great things in my life  and I have achieved a lot but  I think one of the proudest things badass moments in my life is something really small and insignificant I was doing this exercise boot camp and  the last persons like cross the finish line had to do like  30 pushups and it was some guy I didn't really know him at all and the trainer said does anyone want to help him if he's going to help them you have to do half each and no one wanted to help him and then I just decided to start doing push ups with him and I just  it wasn't cuz I wanted to get creditor because I thought it would make me look good I just did it and no one really knows about that but it's just I feel really good about that  is my Buy  press the button

402,female,1,11,<sync> yes okay atlanta georgia um in two thousand and six never uh i don't like it there <laughter> oh it's completely boring and there's very little to do l_a is preferable i think to most places uh because uh i was engaged to my fiancee and we lived in florida i moved there to be with him and um he loves the water but i love the mountains and i missed hiking and uh i didn't love florida and he wasn't tied to it so we decided we wanted to go somewhere we could both be happy and also have um more opportunities in business and all of the great things that it has to offer very <laughter> very easy there's not much i don't like about l_a i love l_a um i think it feels magical uh so many creative different people of all ages um shapes sizes colors races um the mountains the water uh the city all the things that there are to do all the people there are to meet i just i love everything about l_a no uh i'd rather not talk about it um i didn't go to college i'm still figuring that out um i don't know it may may have something to do with animals i have a dog that i really love and i never had a dog um as an adult i had cats and uh um i think i'm a late bloomer so i'm working on that whole conversation i don't i really don't want a job i want a purposeful way to create wealth not just something to make money in the long run it depends on the situation but in general i consider myself more shy although most people would consider me to be outgoing mm put on classical music <laughter> music classical music if i'm especially <ex> especially stressed and um play with my dog go for a walk i think i'm really good at controlling my temper for the most part um before i came here <laughter> um it was just about um financial stress uh um there's probably a lot of examples i think i'd rather move to another question yeah i'd rather not talk about that either <laughter> i'd rather not talk about that not very easy at all um a lot better recently but um i have a history of chronic insomnia and some health problems so it's challenging um not to feel rested most of the time in the past week i've been feeling a lot better um yes i um the weather has changed spring has sprung it's a little warmer i was having um more trouble with my depression in the winter and um having trouble with tolerating cold and so i wasn't doing  a lot of the things that i normally do and i also was sick with the flu um and in the past week i decided um that i was feeling better enough that i needed to kind of get out of my rut and start um getting more focused around things things that i need to do during the day and walking my dog  every day and um not isolating so much and seeing some of my friends more so i was seeing i've been feeling a lot better like i've been making progress and um that uh in the past week things have taken a more positive turn no yes uh it's been quite some time officially it's probably been i don't know exactly but let's see maybe more than fifteen years ago um i was feeling suicidal no um because i found a better alternative um i have been in therapy off and on since i was eighteen and i've tried a variety of um methods and then uh i started working with a neurolinguistic programmer and um that was really the first person that um helped me uh make permanent changes and i was able to get off my anti depressants as well and even though i've struggled with some bouts of depression it's never been anything extremely severe and um it was one of the best things that ever happened well um i was physically ill with uh chronic fatigue syndrome and i had a client that referred me to this person um because he had cured her of that disease and um that was um he treats multiple issues and so everything is interrelated so um once i had my first conversation with him i knew it was the right step for me i was so happy um i felt like i some um i felt that i found the answer that i'd been looking for that  i hadn't given up hope and uh that um <laughter> i was on cloud nine that i i had been suffering for a a while <wh> a long time and i felt that i finally found the answer to the solution that i was looking for i was like it was the best thing i ever did in my life it was the best decision i ever made i felt extremely hopefuly for the first time in a long time <laughter> um i went to um i went to a music store because uh i had been thinking about um taking up an instrument i used to play the violin as a child and uh i've been wanting to do something that would give me more access to my creative side because i felt it's been extremely repressed and um and so i went to the music store to try out um to see what it would feel like to um to handle an the instrument again and see if i thought that that was something i wanted to pursue it was awesome <laughter> mm yeah i'd rather not talk about that <laughter> um well <laughter> there's probably a lot but um i'm always working on being more optimistic um it's been challenging it takes time but um yeah i wish i could hear my own internal voice better <laughter> yeah i have regrets sure yeah um value myself more so that i would make better relationship decisions uh my fiancee is the most positive person in my life my ultimate supporter uh he's i think very unique not uh not at all selfish and uh probably a little too giving for his own good but um always has my best interests at heart has the highest morals of anyone i know would give somebody the shirt off of his back um is a genius in so many ways and uh um i'm pretty lucky i think that i'm not a quitter that despite some very stressful circumstances over long periods of time i haven't given up on taking risks and um
405,female,1,17,essential let you know and then you can let me know okay thanks  thanks  go ahead and move his cord behind you didn't get any way  hi hello  are you okay with this  yes  okay not too bad  I'm from Chicago South Side  I'm back in 1978 when I was 18  lately not much maybe once every two or three years  compared to the letter A  it's totally different you know horrible weather and  it's just a whole different atmosphere  let's see my mother had moved to Africa  I graduated from high school and I had a friend down here so I just thought well let me try la  very easy actually yeah I loved it from the moment I got off the airplane  number one the weather son is very important to me so I love the weather  I don't know just kind of a more laid-back atmosphere variety  of people  and now it's my my Homebase you know my friends that are family  that's how I like my family is here now  I guess the small hug earthquakes  traffic  just basic things like that really  I don't currently but I did throughout my life I travel quite a lot  I just seeing seeing other cultures and seeing more history and meeting people and  just fun at the fun of it as well  let's see what one trip I went to England  Ireland and Scotland and France all in you know one trip  so that was a nice variety  I guess you could say probably skiing in val de saire France  that was fun I'm glad I got to do that  that's great  do you consider yourself more shy  I'm kind of shy by Nature I've tried to grow out of being shy so I'm not fully shy but I was always an extremely shy child  but now here in Culver City this is my environment and I I guess you could say I'm not really shy and in my hometown of Culver City  I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got  to relax I like to just curl up in my bed and read my book take a nap watch TV sometimes on the couch in the living room just you know stay at home and kind of vegetate  pretty good yeah my tempers pretty level  probably with my husband  and  I can't remember the moment what it was about  okay  tell me about your relationship with you  well when you say my family do you mean  my family from childhood or my current family  okay well I guess my current family comes to mind I have two daughters and my relationships pretty good it's okay with them but they're teenagers which you know going they're going through a lot of hormones and they can be kind of bitchy and  and but I have hope that you know they'll grow out of bed and soon someday we'll have a really good relationship  and then there's the husband which  like I guess I could face soon-to-be-ex-husband hopefully soon we need to get a divorce but we're still together due to financial reasons  and yeah yeah so that that's not good relationship with the husband but  but since we have determined that we need to divorce  we don't expect anything out of each other so we don't argue as much so that's good  well  I guess our marriage  I wish I had noticed early on that  you know it was like way off from what I thought it was  how do you say oh my God  hardest decision  I guess leaving my first husband that was pretty hard  well you know we were married and I wasn't content I guess you could say and  I kind of just gave up on our relationship and now that I look back I think it's because  I want children and he would have been happy to never have any and so since I didn't have a father it was very important that I create children with someone who really wanted to be a father and so I was kind of at an age where I needed to start thinking about having children yet I was with someone who really was not into it so that I think that's one maybe the core reason why I was not content and I just felt like this marriage isn't going to work n so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not want to break up and  and I had to leave him because I just wasn't happy and that was that was very hard cuz  yeah  felt like I was hurting him which which I was him he survived he got over and now he's married with two kids but it was hard to leave him  tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from your memory  something I wish I could erase from my memory have to think about that  I'm sure there's something well  yeah there's some  I guess it'd be nice to erase from my memory a recent I'm not resend but an event in my  recent adulthood here in Culver City where one of my best friends  betrayed me by back years ago when my husband first got into real estate she and her family were growing and they really need a larger home and  we just assumed that you know that they would use my husband as their agent supposed to sell their current home current at the time and purchase a new home  and as it turned out they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent and yeah that was devastating  I don't think I've ever been betrayed like that so I wish I could erase that not cuz now you know this was back when the kids were really young  and  my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was let's say  6 Maybe  maybe five anyway her and my best friend's daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other we were pregnant together and they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we run into them in the neighborhood are they run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were just you know like two peas in a pod even those her their moms weren't talking to each other anymore so now they're 13 and 14 and they're in middle school together and they're still very connected in fact she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl and it's just a little awkward you know cuz now these girls are becoming really good friends  your friends and yet I still have this  bad memory of what her  her mom did to to me  that was about 1:10  about 8 years ago  I tried it I try to ignore it and put it out of my head which have been able to  in recent years  but obviously it still comes up  anyway that was that  not that easy I do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time I wake up and can't get back to sleep but or I finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up you know that that difficult thing  well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom and then  you know it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then I wake up again to go to the bathroom  so I guess that's the trigger as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there I don't know I think there's just too much on my mind running through my mind and the day I feel like I haven't accomplished enough during the day so  it's hard for me to just go to sleep when I'm supposed to guess  well I'm kind of used to it now so I just go on to the day probably looking looking tired and  like I'm kind of used to feeling tired I just do what I need to do and sometimes if I'm able to if I'm at home and don't have huge commitments yeah I might just like I said earlier just take a nap or something read my book watch TV whatever  lately have I been feeling  kind of down  on myself down on life  well I have this pending need for separation / divorce  I'm worried that I made a lot of mistakes with my girls now they're teenagers you know on the verge of adulthood  and so I worried that you know I did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance in their early childhood and now it's too late  like I missed out on a lot of things  and yeah I need a job I'm unemployed I don't know what I want to do with my life I know I want to do something and I just wish you know I never did finish college unfortunately because I was traveling and stuff  so I regret that extremely  and I need to get a job and be able to take care of myself cuz I need to  divorce and move on with my life so now I forget what the original question was but that's the state part of the state of Mo  no  yes  well  the first time or or or recently  the first time I guess was you know when I was in my early twenties I was just a little upset about constantly that was another breakup I had to make back then I was  in my early twenties and I needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting cuz I  you know it's hard because he didn't want to break up and I feel like I was hurting him and I didn't understand this feeling I was really upset  how did that was my first time having depression so I didn't really recognize it as depression but I went somehow I had the  knowledge or the I was able to take myself to a psychiatrist I remember I paid for her by the hour and she prescribed Xanax to just help relax me  and so I guess that helped me get through that and then I've had depression throughout the years just so you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as I guess it's usually a relationship you know  yeah so the most recent time I was diagnosed and put on meds that was probably about 2 years ago  no  money and I don't have insurance otherwise yeah I'd be happy to go to therapy anything that might help  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  last time I felt really happy  I don't know I guess maybe  when my children were born  I guess happy I just you know I always wanted children so it's nice  to have them  that's I don't know that's all I can remember of that and I guess I don't remember the good times too well I remember the bad times  something you did recently that you really enjoy  something I did that I really enjoyed  well  that's the way I am  Friday night I went to a friend's house and met up with five other girlfriends and we  we created vision boards and talked and had dinner at one of their house that was that was fun  we get to  stay in college get my degree  get therapy trying to become happy  yeah try to figure out things earlier in life  like  yeah  stay in college and and mainly I think the mean and what it all boils down to no matter what your depressed about it seems like  as soon as the saying goes in the  songs go you know it's all about money the world revolves around money in  having none that in itself is for depressing so besides relationships and different things that have happened in your life having no money as you know it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it so with that in mind I would definitely advise myself to get my college degree and to get a job and stick with it don't quit to go traveling and I'll just stick with a job sick with a company build up your seniority keep your benefits  and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of filled yeah that would have been my biggest piece of advice to myself  not much  I guess  just my daughter's you know there are two beautiful daughters and  I'm proud and glad that I was able to have children some people  aren't even able to do that you know and they try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so that's the one thing I mean I wanted five children and I always wanted a boy which I never had but I guess that's the biggest thing I can think of to be proud of  having my two daughters  I'm a very loyal  friend and person that's why when that friend betrayed me I was so devastating  yeah very loyal very  happy was I going to say I was going to say happy go lucky I don't know where that came from very I meant to say friendly and caring and  yeah I care about people  and I'm interested in people  and I care about animals as well actually that's another thing I'm proud of proud of being a vegetarian  yeah so my daughters and being vegetarian and I'm a vegetarian because I really care about feelings of other beings not only humans but animals to in  you know I don't think that animals should be tortured and live a torturous life just so we can eat them  so what was the question  remember the question  okay  you're welcome by  I did need the tissue one time so that's good  the other sister

440,female,1,19,<sync> yes i'm okay thank you um i was born in east los angeles and yes um the freedom to explore outdoors and with different um weather temperature <temp> you know with weather <clears throat> temperature and climates to go skiing or to the beach maybe in the same day i like that um mm i think probably the overcrowding um and the smog mm not not frequently but i have meeting other people and learning about their environment and their cultures sure um the last trip i've taken outside of here was to italy and um that was my second time being there and i enjoyed it more this time because um i knew what i wanted to see when i came back and um and i was better prepared for italians and their culture i felt i wasn't as uh you know i was just better prepared i thought for that trip um <clears throat> that would be um being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house in the midst of acres and acres and acres of grapes was just magnificent um human development um <clears throat> i actually didn't decide at first to do that i started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant and um i went to a program in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant and through the process i learned that um i had to do a long internship without pay and at the time <t> and i miss i had a family so i had to make a different <diff> a career choice quickly and um so the college offered human development as a major and i um just went right in and used my used <u> used my units that i had already acquired towards that particular major and and i'm happy with it um currently no i stay at home i have a little one uh well he's not so little i'm preparing to go back to work um in the meantime i design jewelry well i have three children um i have a almost four year old and then i have two older children seventeen and twenty three no um that your children the the love <sigh> from them and for them is unconditional all the stages that they go through they're stages all the time for every age <laughter> and then everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages so um i think i'm probably more in tune with those different stages that's why it makes me crazy um and i think that my parents the time that my parents were parents it was just kinda like you know is she fed is she dressed she has a house i mean a roof over her head and we're doing great as parents and we love her and so it wasn't um there wasn't too much i felt that that parents thought about in terms of that in terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there's books for every age every year month you know <clears throat> and um so i think it difference differs in that way tremendously very close <clears throat> outgoing mm i don't i don't um feel uninhibited <u> uninhibited i feel a little you know confident to talk to people i probably talk more than i need to <laughter> um <clears throat> i bead i <clears throat> do i design jewelry that's what i do to relax i'm pretty good i i well i think i um try not to not to um feel or let others know what my emotions are when i'm upset um which is not good 'cause if i don't do anything with them then i know that at some point it's gonna come out and um yeah that that's uh something i have to work on like exercising or something um <clears throat> it was my husband and it was about um he asked me whether i thought about cheating ever in our marriage on him uh really tired of talking about that same topic um well it came it spawned from <f> from a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for many things and um <clears throat> and so he took that information and came home and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me think about cheating and he knows that i've been resentful of him and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating <clears throat> and um <sigh> i we've had this conversation a lot of times and uh i mean not just that but i don't know just about cheating in general and um so i just said what i normally said normally say is that i haven't um cheated and that i did think about that when we were first together and uh but it was just a mere thought and um and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another and that just kinda <sigh> i guess irritated me i was really bothered by that and i just started thinking you know we're having this conversation yet again and why are we having this conversation <laughter> are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that that went into that um argument i mean it wasn't ayelling <y> yelling i mean it was part conversation and part texting um <sigh> not talking at all <laughter> um <sigh> mm pretty much any situation that involves my children and if i've yelled because i really don't like if i came to the point where i've had more of yelled it bothers me because um i was yelled at a lot and i just feel bad about that and i try really hard to not handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset i might get and result in in yelling hmm that would probably be whether to keep a pregnancy or not yeah yeah i um i was just talking about it yesterday actually and um oh i was pregnant and i had wanted i wasn't married yet and i had wanted to be married and but i just didn't think that i it was the right time for me and um i had pretty much made up my mind that i was not going to keep that pregnancy but i made the decision by myself and when my partner found uh discovered that i was pregnant he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me and so that decision was quite hard because i felt obligated to do so and felt super guilty to not and <drops microphone> oops and uh this is on correctly um hang on this ear piece is falling there we go that was probably the hardest decision actually you know what no i wouldn't say that's the hardest decision i ever had to make i'm sorry the hardest decision that i had to make in my life was whether or not <clears throat> um the hospital should um unplug the life or um life support machine for my father or not that was the hardest decision um because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that and to have been um to resort to the situation that he was in not capable of doing anything at all either speaking for himself um was beyond it who he was and i just couldn't see him like that anymore and he would be a vegetable i was told so i agreed to um resort that not hardly ever <laughter> too many things running on my mind um and pretty much um mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends uh even though i know that they're gonna come <co> i mean i'm constantly worried about uh how they are when they come home and so i really can't fall asleep on the weekends most of the time but um and you <y> sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting a good night's sleep i'm just exhausted <ex> exhausted i pass out but it's hard very stressed mm my son is is um has been uh in dealing with some legal issues and um currently is incarcerated and uh it's been really hard yes i've been probably very short moody irritable well i often think about a lot of things that aren't even happening <laughter> my mind just goes from one point a to point b and i don't even know how i got there um you know it's interesting uh yeah no yes about three years ago um my um o_b_g suggested i i uh see a psychiatrist yes well um i've in the process of changing therapists so it's been about because the program that i was in um lost funding and i lost my therapist or the therapist that i was working with and so it's been about two months maybe three now and um but i did notice when i was in therapy um that it was just an intricate part of my my life my week to see my therapist um it really helped me cope um <sigh> when i picked up my son <laughter> up from um when he was released from um jail um a go getter uh probably you know uh she would use the term hustler but meaning that i'll i'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to do what i need to do to support my family i mean you know legally of course um outgoing um maybe sometimes a little too for too outgoing for her um and compassionate sensitive loyal mm all the things that remind me of my mother <laughter> well yelling the yelling part was one um just <j> just the little things that used to drive me so crazy i see <s> can see myself doing them and it bothers me a lot regarding what mm <clears throat> um not too much really i don't know <clears throat> to go to college right after high school and not wait um and <sigh> that i didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy or that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and not in a relationship and still be happy and live life um what did i do mm i visited my son yesterday and that was really good yeah i was happy that he was safe um my children and uh my accomplishments in um school and work bye
346,female,1,23,yes  i'm okay  here in los angeles  there's a lot of things to do i love the beach  um i love the i love that it's sunny all the time  um the amount of people  um  that's really about it the amount of people  just a little  i just like um going to new places and just discovering new things  um i recently went to new york i was there for about three months  um and it was extremely boring i went to western new york  um and it was extremely uh snowy and um  i didn't <didn> was in a position where i didn't have a car so i didn't get to go very many places and i was in a small town   so um  i uh  uh it was beautiful for what i got to see but really  it wasn't really much to it <laughter>  yeah  um  both i'm both an introvert and an extrovert  um  i really enjoy doing things by myself  um  i um have a lot of my own um my likes and dislikes and i've spent a lot of time alone even though um i have <ha> i do have a lot of friends and uh when i do go out i i do tend to meet a lot of people but um i also enjoy um being by myself a lot  um  probably outgoing creative um  talented  um fun trustworthy  um  i studied language um  and um physics  and um  math no i'm not  i'm actually um i'm um i'm trying to be an actress  it was something that i fell into when i was a teenager  scrubbed_entry and uh i really enjoyed doing it and i hadn't done it for years um  so i figured why not i just came back to california and might as well try something that i did enjoy really doing   um so far um i just got picked up by an agent  so i haven't really done anything yet as an adult  but um  i'm hoping  hoping something it'll be fruitful   um  <sigh> i really don't haven't had too many  um  i guess my sister she's done really well  um  my boyfriend he's a  he's a very positive human being  um  but um  really i haven't had too many positive influences  um  i'm close i mean we <w> we hang out um i i don't tell them everything  um they're kind of judgmental  but um  other than that i mean i mean we hang out i mean i see them every day  um  geez um  it's kinda hard for me to relax um i mean i try to watch t_v um and i read  a lot um  that's probably about it i read i do a lot of sleeping <laughter> i'm a little depressed so um  yeah it's kinda it's xxx like i said it's really hard for me to relax  um  it isn't  um i tend to think a lot  um about the things that stress me out  um i've been through a lot of a lot of stuff so um  yeah so i i don't i don't i don't sleep very well at night and if i do fall asleep i wake up all through the night usually with some kind of anxiety attacks  um  i dream a lot about um the stuff that has uh  has affected me throughout the years so um  it's usually you know like i i'll dream about something that stressed me out and then i'll wake up and my my chest'll hurt    um  or just i just can't sleep all night because i just think i seem to be i don't know if i'm afraid to go to sleep  but i uh <sigh> i just i don't know i feel like that <th> that's a vulnerable place for me  because of stuff that've happened to me  so um  i i so i sleeping is just not really something i do well  um  tired  i'm uh  i'm moody i'm very sensitive  um  i uh i'm just negative <ne> a negative person  um which really that's not me um  i uh yeah i'm like <l> judgmental is not me either um i just  i'm just not a not a nice person to be around  um  i try to <t> i i spend a lot of my time reading i try to go out and do um i force myself to go out and do things um  just to keep myself involved  um so that i don't uh sit <si> just sit around and and and dwell on the fact that i can't sleep and i i try to um get myself as exhausted as i possibly can  um by running around and and and doing things  so  um it's difficult  um i do like there is a part of me that doesn't wanna  i don't really wanna go out and do things i have to actually force myself to um if i have make appointments i uh  i make appointments to like for auditions or or um  even to do this i um i i tend to uh  just not  like at the last minute i'll i'll try to convince myself not to go <laughter> but then i force myself to anyways   yes  um i've been diagnosed for two instances  um i was diagnosed <dia> diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago  and then i was diagnosed again um in august um  the first time it was um  i just wasn't sleeping <sl> because of the not sleeping um   and the uh just the stress <st> the unbelievable stress  um  and then the second time it was a xxx uh once again i started with the not sleeping um and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me um  and i just i i just couldn't take it anymore  so i i figured um  i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um  not thinking life was worth it and and i i i that's i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated  yeah  it was  i no <n> do not um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um  get out of my environment  um and uh  and that seemed to help a lot  um  and uh out here i i was i just the counselors that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much  um they just  they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and i don't believe that that's what i needed  um  yeah so um  yeah  <sigh> stressed um uh lately i've been really sad and i don't know why   um  but like i said i've been trying to combat that by um   keeping myself busy  um  actually um  i'm kind of a couple days ago  i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy   um but then i went back to  being you know going back to feeling miserable  so um  well i realized  i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep  and um  i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky  um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me  and uh  you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that  and that made me really happy  um  yeah  thank you <laughter> oh geez um  i've had so many years of just  just bad just a lot of bad  that it there has it's been a long time  since i've been proud of anything  i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through  um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've  gotten rid of themselves a long time ago  but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um  there's gotta be a silver lining  so  um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh  i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people  and um  and truthful and i still i still have drive in me  yeah  ugh <sigh> so much um  my last marriage um not getting out when i should have  um  and uh just i regret a lot <sigh> um the any situation that would've had a red flag um  eh just get out of it you know eh some things just don't work and um  no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um  i i would tell myself um to um  that it's not selfish  to let go of a bad situation  and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself  so if had i known that then had had i known that then i i i probably would've done better in life so  yeah  <sigh> um people who um  when people are down on me for my faults  um that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people steal still relive when i'm trying to forgive myself um  people who are mean to other people uh people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy um just anybody who picks on the little guy  um  you know people who don't care about the environment or animals um  i just <jus> i think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be  and uh it's it's disheartening and it it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make um everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do  and uh i that makes me mad  <laughter> i vent <laughter> um  yeah i tend to vent and then uh  and them um and then it's usually over i try not to bad mouth people um i try to just talk through it until um until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore mm i try not to get angry um  because i have a really bad temper and it um  and it can get outta hand so um  what i do is i i <laughter> something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap  um <laughter> if i'm not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap um i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind and come back to it  um  it was a couple days ago it was actually with my mother um  it was about um  actually she thought that i had taken a shirt from her  and um she was screaming and yelling at me and um  i was i was tired um i was it was late and um  i started to yell at <a> back at her you know because i was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty um  and you <yo> <sigh> it's uh going back to my past you know when i was younger and you know i didn't care about you know people's things and i would just kinda take and do whatever i wanted to and i'm not i'm so far from that person   um and i it it hurt me so i got mad and i and i started to yell and argue  mm kinda petty and stupid but  at the time it it seemed  it seemed uh  viable  um  hmm one of my most memorable experiences  um  god <go> i've had so many um  maybe it was um  i don't know um  it was  probably um  graduating pharmacy school  um i felt pretty great i didn't know if i was doing  uh very very well or not um and i ended up getting like on my last test scores i getting <get> ended up getting like ninety eight percent  and um  i uh  i actually i didn't <did> i had no confidence <laughter> that i had done well in class in school at all and i i didn't even know how i was getting the grades i was getting um so that was a really big accomplishment for me um  and uh yeah that was a great it was a great memory yeah  yeah  um  i'm reliable  um  i um  i'm talented  um i i'm a good listener um  i'm always there to help people  um  i tend to always try to do the right thing  um  sometimes actually i forget that i have any good qualities but  um  and just  i uh  all around i try to be you know as as good and the best person that i can be to other people and myself um  yeah  um  going to comedy shows  um  just um  having moments where you just laugh with people  um  sometimes just reading puts me in a good mood uh  i don't know probably that's about it  uh huh  okay  thank you  bye
422,female,0,12,what is my hair doing over there so I see myself again  it's a little better  so this is mimicking her actual positions  total ask someone to have a conversation kind of threw her  okay thanks  hi  I'm not a therapist  are you okay with this  so how are you doing  all right  originally originally I'm from Korea  I went out with a year old  yes  almost never ever been to Korea once  I love the weather and being by the ocean and the culture has a lot of things to do with the food was a lot to like  the traffic  it seems like  we're having a lot of economic difficulties in the parking tickets or super high sometimes I'm really annoyed by our government  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot  fire shoes  did he say buy your shoes  your shoes aren't showing I have traveled a bit and sort of traveled I haven't traveled in a little bit in a little while  oh just  it  it helps you keep things in perspective about our life here it's exciting and it makes me feel like I'm actually I'm really living cuz sometimes we're stuck in this bubble here in LA and seeing other places you realize that you know life is about a lot of different things that you don't think about everyday  well  one of my trips I went  I went to Singapore and then to Thailand and it was when I was with my ex-boyfriend and we went to  he had he was a sales engineer for a systems engineer but he he did well that year and so this is kind of like a company thing so we went to Singapore for a few days and that was really interesting you know of course it's a lot different over there it's not just like going to Canada or something but they had a big reception in the evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principles of company which is all fun and after Singapore we did some chores in Singapore this really isn't interesting experience it's really clean there and it's really it's not a lot of crime but the government is very is it's a little bit imposing but it was very interesting then we went to Thailand and that was almost as really completely different cuz like jungle we went to  Phuket little island and it was just it was very primitive compared to Singapore just in a lot of different ways with her and just bring it was nice and everything was very cheap had a massage on the beach for $8 and it was interesting  he has an hour for $8  well I'm in school right now and I didn't I didn't finish school and I was younger because and  had health problems  so here I am I'm I'm just doing my General Ed right now I'm going to SMC  yeah I'm happy  call my dream job would be to be a veterinarian but I probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily ocelot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and and in a Veterinary capacity  I think I'm right on the cusp it depends on the environment and the people I'm with and how comfortable I am but I'm really outgoing when I feel comfortable with people and I'll be really reserved if I'm not  well I mean aside from sleeping  I like like relaxing things like going for a bike ride on the Strand or if I'm at home I'll just like reading  a lot of times I can just lay there and  my mind might be doing things but I'm kind of relaxing  I really good I don't have  I would say there's certain things that  they can really like make me  like when I see Injustice has or things like that then  I mean I can really feel it but I never just likes laugh a handle or throw things or even you know yell  show me some arguments I mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument  I would say last summer  when  I think it was after a baseball game there's a group of us and we went to  we went to have shabu-shabu after the game and and I think  and I know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like she's a good friend in some ways and she's a traffic kind of distant in other way so I don't consider her like someone that I would confide in and you know it was any problems but sometimes we just have she's very touchy and she's got the same sense of humor I do so I think she had said something to me during the night which kind of bother me but you know I just kind of  that's just how she is and then I guess I said some things that she  spell were  I wish he gets really offended easily I think but after that we didn't talk for a while but then we then one day she called me up and then we're friends again  but like she never has never confronted me  ever had  hardest decision  it was leaving my ex-boyfriend  how did you do  well  it wasn't  it was a long time coming I mean I was thinking about it  for like 5 years  you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he's a really good guy but we just had a lot of  we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements so I had thought about it and thought about it and  we are already engaged but we've been together for a long time so  I don't know  I was always is always on my mind like should I get married or should I not and then finally we were just always having  we're always went with the word I'm looking for  we were just having these little snippy disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and I just decided that I was going to leave and I did  it was really hard it was it was the hardest  decision of my life and I can say that definitively  and  but I I think it was for the best  who's probably leaving my job  for well to help my friend start a business in Nevada  and when I when I I really like my job I mean it was it was pretty good it was right over at the beach and when I told him that I was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me in a different position which is awesome  and that was really stressful for me because  I already promised my friends have to leave I would have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't  for her wanting me to come over there it was really really stressful and I stress over it for about three weeks until I actually laughed and when I went over there  like we had we had made agreements about how much they were going to pay me and blah blah blah when I got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that I needed a certain amount and the other principles of the company where you know it was a hard situation cuz she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much and also they were a different religion and it was very strange and they were all when I was I was surrounded by Mormons and I don't have anything against Mormons but it was very different because I was kind of an outsider there and then also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there so I would say that's when it's it's it's  it just a pivotal point in my life and I think that  I really wish I had just stayed  well if you can erase something from my memory then I would probably say  memory  like really if if I could erase something from my memory what would I want to erase everything  can we think of anything I mean  even like that that bad decision that I made  you know it has value in it so I can't really say that I would want something erasing maybe if I was like raped or something and it was really horrifying then I would but I don't  well if your time about being in a deep sleep I'm in a deep sleep a lot but  I never feel rested and that's it's a medical problem of mine  can you tell me  well I always feel like I haven't slept for two days and  there are points in in the day  I would say during some days are points in the day where I really feel alert and alive and and rested but their short-lived  but I sleep a lot I sleep  pretty crappy physically pretty crappy  no thanks  now  I haven't been officially diagnosed with depression but  that's that's usually what doctors  like my sleeping problem hasn't been diagnosed I'm I'm in the process of really working to get it diagnosed but that's the first thing that they try and  figure out they they've given me like depression drugs before but they haven't helped with my sleep  but I do  I do  I would say I feel down sometimes  my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down I would say that I do feel down sometimes a lot of time but it's not  I would say is reasonable considering the situation that I'm in  okay  I need triggered by something  they're just triggered by Tech that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult but  I wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular  oh there I mean  I mean for a long. Of time or every night I experience happiness like when I go out with friends or I go and you know I've  find some great new dish I like I mean  what type of Happiness are you looking for  well  I mean right now  my friend just had surgery and so I'm staying with her this week I'm really enjoying it I mean even though we could never live together I can never live with live with her long-term and I'm sure she couldn't live with me long term but I'm having fun and  you know she just she installed the Groupon app on her on her phone yesterday cuz she's been paying too much for laser hair removal installed it on her phone and then today she's she's looking up cupcakes so she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her as a Groupon deal so I mean you know there's a little fun things like that  how your best friend are you  probably  OCD  and  probably thinks I'm pretty prissy compared to her  I think that she would  say that have a good heart or very different  it probably that I am  I should ask her  I know we go out so I think she say that I'm fun  but she has mentioned that I'm I'm a very private person and that I know I've I knew before she said that  why  I have what I told you I have I have a lot of problems right now  and  so I don't really  tell people about them  it is kind of a kind of a killjoy but also  people can feel I feel that people can feel less comfortable if they perceive that you have a have difficulties and they feel kind of  it's just uncomfortable like oh they maybe they should help her they feel guilty but they have busy lives so it's kind of traits of gaap but I would say even before even before this difficult time in my life I've been  I put a private person I don't know why  I think a lot and I'm a deep thinker  and  maybe it's a  you know it  not like I feel like I feel abnormal but maybe I just have a lot of thoughts that don't seem doesn't seem appropriate to share with people or not sure  well one thing that I regret right now is  yeah I haven't really found  somebody  you got to spend the rest of my life with so I would tell myself to concentrate more on that cuz once you hit 40 it's it's it's a lot harder  I would say  that I persevered I'm very proud that  even though I have a lot of  difficulties in my life  the fact that I'm a male making this commitment to go to school and I'm doing it on my own  and  you know it's  it's kind of a  if people if people knew all the problems today have they be like well you know why are you worried about school but  I really feel that  you know I'm I'm doing this and I'm really proud that even through everything and getting a raise  okay thanks  hi
424,female,0,3,<sync> hi yes today is a wonderful day i am doing just absolutely marvelous i was born in cleveland ohio i was raised in tucson arizona and came to los angeles when i was sixteen years old yes mm uh i've only been back once since i left it's a whole another community when i was growing up i'm so glad i grew up there because it was a great sense of community which i think we don't have here in los angeles <sniffle> uh my my grandmother died and left property for my father so we came here to manage her property property uh it was pretty easy for me i was still young and it was easy to adapt so i'm pretty good at meeting people so uh that has never been a problem i traveled a lot as a child so i was used to moving and going to new places meeting new people seeing new things it's an adventure and i like the adventurous life oh one of my best trips i had it was in nineteen i'm dating myself but nineteen sixty four <sniffle> i came out here to visit my grandmother from cleveland ohio and i went to an indian reservation and i got a little note card about the reservation when i got back home i wrote to the reservation and i told them i when i came <ca> went back to school in september i would have to write uh deliver a speech rather about what i did over the summer and i told them i wanted to talk about going to the indian reservation and would they send me something and they sent me this huge kachina indian doll and that was <wa> that was a wonderful experience to have the thing is worth now if i still had it i found out like a quarter of a million dollars so <laughter> mm but that's one of the best xxx um i could be a little bit of both um i'm pretty when i have to be i can be outgoing 'cause i'm good at meeting <mee> talking to people and meeting people but sometimes i have a little bashful side a little shy side of me too so so a little bit of both i studied business administration <ad> administration with a uh emphasis in marketing and advertising um well i really i started in computer science but that was back in the day when computer science wasn't this what it is today and um i liked <li> i was good at it but it wasn't any interaction with people and i love people so i wanted something that would bring me interaction with people so i went into marketing and i was working for a t_v station where i was going to school so that fit in line in marketing advertising so no now i'm a photographer i'm a celebrity photographer i shoot a lot of stars i shoot on the red carpet i shoot a lot of special events and anything else people will pay me for <laughter> it's not hard at all it's my passion i love it it's like not working i'm in my dream job i i just need to get more jobs <j> jobs to that pay pay me well because there's a lot of times as a photographer you have to do a lot of things <thin> events for free to get known so it's a building process of relationships so i'm still in that process of building relationships so that i can get more paid jobs but this is my dream job i love what i do <laughter> well now i'm really back into it i used to do it a while then i got away from it but it's meditation i practice meditation and i try to do it twice a day in the morning and at night before i go to sleep i work with oprah and deepak chopra and anybody else who provides me with meditation and i use that to calm my body um i can generally control my temper sometimes i get set off i guess like any other human person <per> being but i work at trying to keep a moderate and temperate uh temper in personality oh wow we i argued with my daughter the other day about something i said and i did not mean to say it to hurt her but it obviously did and we argued about that what my intentions were my intentions were never to hurt her mm and maybe what i said did and that's what started the argument oh god i felt terrible because i i never intended to hurt my daughter and i never would wanna hurt her and i felt bad that she had been hurt by what i had said so i had to have to guard my words and watch my thoughts well i don't have much of a relationship with my family <f> with my brothers and sisters and mother and father my parents live far away so it's just my two daughters here with me and we have a pretty good relationship you know we try to work my my daughter's a makeup artist and i'm a photographer so we work a lot together in the industry so sometimes i think we're up on each other too close we need a little more space yeah when i say the wrong things <laughter> it's no it's never easy to be a parent it's a work in progress making the right decisions about things sometimes the love the feel the feeling of accomplishment that you were able to raise the highest creation on this planet to be a a uh wonderful and productive human being i'm not as strict as my parents were i give my kids a little more freedom to find out who they are um i'm not real religious like they do but i am very spiritual um so i brought them up different from me on the religious tip and um i'm more i listen more to them i think than what my parents did it was you were to be seen and not heard when i was growing up and i let my kids' voice be heard one night i had a bad night that changed my life and i don't know wanna go into details i feel bad about that night <laughter> yeah i could've stayed home <laughter> wow i'm trying to think about a situation maybe the handling of how i me and my husband divorced i think i could've handled that a little differently well we we i think we really loved each other a lot and we just it was it was something that had come to a a end and the way we separated was kind of explosive and i think both of us could've handled it better but i think i played a part in in keeping a lot of drama going 'cause i was hurt that we were breaking up and kinda devastated 'cause i wanted my child to be raised with her father so i think it looking back now which is you know hindsight is twenty twenty vision i could've handled things a little better but what can you do you do the best that you can at that time if you knew better you'd do better the hardest decision i've ever had to make the hardest decision i've ever had to make was i was on my way to work as an enrollment counselor on a plane had a stroke was going to make an a connection and to get on the other plane to and then go to the hospital and a doctor was sitting behind me and he told me that i could not get on that plane because i might have another stroke that was a hard decision 'cause i was in dallas texas all by myself i did not i mean i was in there with an employee but i would be left all by myself 'cause my employees had to go on to montgomery alabama where we were headed and i had to make a decision should i stay or should i go but my life was in the balance so i made the decision to stay and go to the hospital but that was a hard one <sniffle> ugh overwhelmed i mean here i am on my way to work you know i flew to different states every week and uh to help kids get get admitted into college and here i am on my way to work and i'm on a plane and i feel this weird feeling coming over the left side of my body and i say my prayers and i go to sleep and then when i wake up to get off the plane i can't remove my luggage from the overhead compartment which i did every week so i knew something was wrong it was it was when you to your life and the whole world in your hand and you don't know what's gonna happen next so it was very disturbing very traumatic and i you know you don't know what's happening to you it's so the weirdest thing riding to the hospital in a medical ambulance that was a weird experience yeah but i'm here i you know i survived it the doctor told me nobody survives it a stroke on a plane and i survived so the universe wasn't finished with me yet you know what that's sometimes i have a little problem with it um sleeping a little bit sometimes i i get wired up <laughter> i get wired up just because i'm one of those real energetic persons and i have to finish what i set out to do and until i finish i can't go to sleep so sometimes it's hard for me to go to sleep other times i can lay down and just go but depends on what's going on in my head um i'm sluggish um probably a little on edge but i try and keep a a upbeat personality i'm a real energetic person so i try to but you know if you're tired your body is still talking to you so lately i've been feeling really well um except i've been having some problems because i have a um since i had the stroke i have nerve damage in my hand and in my face and so i just it's i thought it's been over a year since i had the stroke but i thought by now it would have gotten a little better and it hasn't but i'm so grateful to be alive that that is really minor <mi> minor compared to the bigger picture and i wasn't fortunately <for> fortunately my i didn't lose my facial structure or you know my face is not screwed up like a lot of people are i still can use my hands i still can shoot with my camera even though my left hand is is diminished in use but i can shoot with my right hand as a photographer so i can still keep doing my work um so you know i have to keep a good upbeat energy going on for me to keep for me to be successful no but i went through depression uh from being knocked unconscious five times when i was a school teacher every ball there was that you could name soccer ball baseball basketball name that ball hit me in my head and i suffered from having like sleep apnea and not being able to sleep from being hit so many times and knocked unconscious in the head so no only i don't go to therapy because um i don't i don't have any medical right now so i'm not able to get therapy they only offer that to people with medical it's hard to get it <sniffle> and then i don't i'm not working <work> yeah it sucks i'm not working right now because i'm still trying to get my disability so that i can get well 'cause i wanna be a fulfilled human being and i wanna be totally and you know the system it'll be almost two years before i go for a hearing so that's kind of depressing to think after all the years i've been working since i was sixteen and it's taking me it's been over a year it was a year i had the stroke february two thousand twelve and we are now in march of two thousand thirteen and i won't have a hearing until september two thousand thirteen just to tell me if i get the disability or not that's been very depressing for me because i'm wondering where i lived off my savings in the last year and i got put my daughter through college she finished and now she's having to take care of me and she's still looking for a job and my life is kinda up in the air right now 'cause i'm wondering what comes next and so i'm just praying for guidance <sniffle> i feel happy every day every day i wake up and i can breathe and i can see and i can walk and i can talk and i can still shoot my photograph i'm happy it's just a good thing to be in the present moment and to be alive <sniffle> mm you know what i figured like what good are regrets you can't change the past all you can do is change right here and right now so just live <li> move forward mm what advice would i give myself <sniffle> don't let anything get in your way you know keep a good personality and a energetic spirit and just keep pushing energetic talkative uh won't take no for an answer uh follow through reliable um good spirited giving loving um i'm most proud of that i have been able to find out my creative side i've been a visual artist i never took a art lesson before i taught art <sniffle> um i was in my late twenties before i even discovered that i could draw and paint um i'm a doll collector uh i'm i'm my creative side is what i'm most proud of because it's been able to help me being creative i can no matter what even when i i was still very ill from having a stroke i could still go out and just go take pictures and that was so soothing to my soul that i'm i'm i'm glad that i have a creative side and that i found it and have utilized it mhm uh huh and that's is that it bye bye bye
352,female,0,10,next  are you okay  yes  I'm doing pretty good  I'm from Oklahoma  yep Oklahoma City  the weather is great I love being near the ocean and the palm trees and mountains I just love it here  I was pretty easy there's a few differences of huge City compared to where I'm from so traffic has definitely been an adjustment for me  I just always wanted to live in California hated being landlocked in Oklahoma and just wanted to get out to the West Coast be near the ocean  I studied psychology and minor in art  no not at the moment  well actually I think I misunderstood your question I'm not still working on my degree but I am working in the field of psychology I know I just got hired working at a group home for teenage boys to has been in trouble with the law  my dream job  I don't really know I think I just want to help people however I can and I just like working with people in the realm of psychology so I think I may already have my dream job  to relax I like to read and watch movies I like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or hang out with friends  what are some things that  things that make me really mad probably Injustice towards other people people being mistreated or abused and people being lied to and deceived including myself I hate being lied to  limonoid depends on the situation but I tried to just like count to 10 and take a deep breath and and not let my emotions caused me to react in a negative way so I just try and like calm down before I say anything  it depends again on the situation and like who I'm angry with most the time I'm pretty good at controlling it but sometimes I think like like most people I lash out at the people that I'm close to the stew at times and those moments I'm not that good at controlling it  when was the last time I argue with someone was probably with my parents I've been having some car trouble lately and I'm also running low on money so I'm sure I don't even remember exactly but I'm sure we kind of probably thought about the fact that I you know need to be more self-sufficient and independent and take care of my own things like car issues  I'm very close with my family they're still in Oklahoma but I talked to them on the phone all the time  oh definitely I mean my mom I think she's probably the person that I'm closest to and she just she's a great role model she's a wonderful person and she's very hardworking and very unselfish and I just want to be like her in those ways  probably the time I went bungee jumping over the Nile River and Uganda I still kind of have flashbacks of that moment just Free Falling it was like the coolest experience ever and I love doing things that are crazy like that so it was a fun time  yeah well I I have traveled a lot nowadays I don't travel so much anymore but I used to work for a Cruise Line Norwegian Cruise Line so I would go travel all the time with them and then I also did an 11 month long trip around the world is a mission trip so I just went and helped out and different third world countries is really cool  I just love going to different places seeing new places and meeting all different types of people because it's easy to just like get so absorbed in your own small bubble that you forget that there's a huge world out there and there's all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to Branch out and see and meet those types of people and see just the diversity in the terrain of the earth even in the way that the earth looks in different places is cool  no I have not served in the military  nope  no I never been formally diagnosed although I would say I probably diagnose myself with depression just after having studied at a lot in Psychology throughout the years I've probably 99% sure that I have struggled with depression and off-and-on so yeah  lately it's been pretty easy but throughout the years I've definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia just like either not being able to fall asleep or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and so right now I'm not really experiencing too much of that but in the past it's definitely been an ongoing issue for me  I'm not a private person when I don't sleep well leave is extremely like important for me I think maybe more so than a lot of people I'd I like need good sleep to function  I've been feeling really good over the past several months I was unemployed after coming out here and that was really really tough and I just recently got offered my job just like last week so I definitely think I've been going through a lot of crap and just a lot of depression but it's like lifted a lot of has lifted off of me because I don't have that pressure any longer of like how am I going to make ends meet the city's really expensive and I don't have a job and so I feel I feel much more relieved than I have been feeling just good  yeah well I mean just like I said over the past week or so I've become a lot more positive I was kind of like feeling a bit like a Hermit in a way it's just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people and of course like I said not having a job kind of causes you to kind of  just like being your own shall I guess and that was kind of how it was how it's been for me and just since I got offered a job I just have so much more confidence in like positivity that things are starting to work out for me up to good  probably a couple of days ago actually I went I went to explore part of the South Bay Area that I hadn't really been to before and it was I was just going to go for a jog along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and it was just beautiful and then I went for a drive up kind of off the Sleep Cliff for the beautiful scenery that I never seen before and I just like was overwhelmed how pretty it was and I was just like I can't believe that I get to live here so that was definitely a happy moment for me  my best friend would probably say that I'm very daring and bold and fearless that I'm unique and artistic and I don't I've guess I should probably say that I'm a non-conformist I don't really think the way that a lot of people do and I question everything so it's going to be a good or bad thing but  probably just like the fact that I I really tried to live my life with like no regrets and just I tried to live a very exciting life in a way and I think that especially ever since I finished college and have been traveling like I haven't I've tried moving all different places by myself so I think just the fact that I am not really afraid I don't let things hold me back I just if I want something or if I want to do something I just do it and I guess in a way like I like that about myself in the fact that I'm really independent and can just go and do whatever I feel like doing even if it's hard I still I'm proud that I've overcome a lot of those struggles  oh there's like minor things that I regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major cuz I think pretty much everything that I've done I've learned from whether it's good or bad so I wouldn't really change anything  I would say I would tell myself when I was a kid that I  should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything is possible because I guess as I've grown into an adult I've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and then if you really want something you can go after and you can get it and so I would just tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you want to do  let's see that's kind of hard  oh I guess I went home recently for Christmas back to Oklahoma and I got to see some of my friends from college that I hadn't seen in some of them I haven't seen in like since I graduated so much has been like 4 years ago so it was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun  you're welcome by  okay  did she stay up and look okay during that hotel
305,male,0,7,"okay looks good so we can just move around a little bit to activate the connect him till we see a green skeleton looking thing up there around there goes okay perfect 7 to go ahead and start at the virtual human that you'll be talking to when it's over will you just go ahead and ring this Bell so I know that it's done  okay  hi I'm Ellie think I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment think of me as a friend I don't judge I can have a computer I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you I'll ask a few questions to get it started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential  how are you doing today that's good  where are you from originally originally I'm from California phone in Glendale  nice  how do you like your living situation I'm not too happy with it  why is unemployed at the moment but actually she can doing what I'm supposed to be doing and there's some  prospector but hopefully I'll learn something today  yeah  what's it like for you living with them why I want is a girlfriend so I can shoot her roommate  how do you know when I met her last year and  been through some troubling times but we're starting to see a light at the end it though  tell me more about that  the troubling times  I would let me see  wow I got a DUI last year and lost my job I'm a truck driver by trade so that kind of  show me way off of having a $1,400 a week job and then going to nothing, like plus losing my my license, I really threw me off and I couldn't know  haven't really  found any that was interested in so I start cooking  and our trying to see you which other route I can go as far as having some kind of a career and so  I'm truchas and going to The Culinary field but in the meanwhile I still have to work as hard to find a word with that without going to school and so but I think today I applied a trial so hopefully all  get that guy should have that job actually so  but I'm trying to see a light like citizen of that don't know a little by little  what's your dream job  my dream job would be probably forestry service on the wilderness  hiking alone  well know I have a lot of RAM on I'm an exotic animal trainer by trade and so and I like being I don't like people too much. So being outdoors and I've always enjoyed being outdoors that's how I like being a truck driver I've traveled the world I don't necessarily like being in a warehouse or an office I'm more of a  outdoors type of guy show  I'd like to hear about one of your trips  one of my trips would be  I spent a year-and-a-half in Japan and on the lower Island there that they built that bridge the largest bridge in the world  I wonder to work for  for an all-white a lot and all white tiger act and working for JP circus shows interesting that a lot of people that Island hadn't really seen a lot of Americans that was one of the islands also that we that they bombed so it was a lot of negativity but I probably have a good behavior and all those times that you know I  I enjoyed my shopping out for all the traveling and meeting new people and you know different Universe foods and  can you get experience for me all that whole experience was pretty good for traveling around the circus  ingrate nice  I really like about ale  probably  I want some of things I like about that way there's not a lot that I like but I don't like but I like Hollywood I like to eat the movie industry  the huge show  different different piano different  different ethnics of people here in Ohio  I enjoy talking to you if you know a lot of foreigners so you know I'd like to see where it came from and what what it's like there  yes  traffic cirrhosis  yeah  what are some things that make you really mad  traffic ignorance  being disrespectful being disrespectful or whatever you know other people being disrespectful towards you or other people  okay or I if I'm riding my bike people tend to almost from yours or if I'm not totally paying attention to traffic and all I find myself sometimes  you don't happen to wait to see what they're going to do instead of I have in the right away or stuff like that  yeah big time  what do you do when you're annoyed  what do I do when I'm annoyed  price and third shifter and vent and speak my mind even though I myself wishing that I carried rocks in my back pocket so I can let you know what happened so much where I I just  if it makes me what people will do some time with me oh you almost get run over all you know how I fight almost get run over probably on a daily basis  and I wouldn't mind attention right  how hard is that a try not to react to your reactions  yeah  when was the last time you argue with them  it was my girlfriend and it was about being honest  I'm pretty honest with  I'm open and honest about it anything and everything and what it was about was just her lying to me telling me that she had told our landlord something and I know she done something in that in that aspect and I come to find out a week later that it it was a total why I fell and I just  damn I got it all  yeah  how did you feel in that moment  transducer the word for it  just said I don't know now that whether I can be there because it was  I felt hurt and all that you know it would have been in a relationship for a little bit and that's probably one of my biggest pet peeves is being honest  I don't like I said I don't hold back on for y'all in anything and everything that I do or say so and if you're lying about something and Wall-E just your always having to cover up  more lies with the lies that mean that you already told him I  I don't see any kind of  took a lot from me trusting her now and I'll or whatever now I'm like you know it's like truthful with it not know it was going to hurt our relationship  volume  what are some things you like to do for fun  fun  by going to the beach  Russian dark but haven't done it in a while I love the paint I got in the watercolor painting and pretty gifted at that and  I want to try some other mediums and let me see you I love fishing  I haven't gone in a while though  I like driving truck no more and my job are you I wasn't really really enjoyed it I don't like driving through cities but I usually when I'm in the middle of the night when she all the star light star gazing I'll see if I can pick out some of those astronomy start off the affair and  I'm a pretty easygoing guy so shooting pool  sunshine  most memorable experiences  good or bad  whatever comes to your mind  most memorable experiences  I'll probably  playing with lions and tigers  wrestling a baby elephant in a in a mud puddle  I just enjoy myself  awesome  not  I don't have much family as it is  at least here in the states I don't know miles from Central America so but I'm not close to I have  three brothers one sister  and I'm probably not really really close to none of my siblings I speak with one brother  quite a bit my other youngest brother and I just rather not know you're not this guy try to keep it on a professional basis my sister I don't talk to her at all my other brother underneath me I haven't spoken to him in years. I'm just close my mom my knees some of my nephews and that's about it  okay can you have done anything to avoid it  have I done anything to avoid it  to avoid them  yeah I just don't talk to my don't call my phone ask about on my you know I talked to my mom quite a bit my brother quite a bit but I just don't bring up those subjects or if they are brought up I just know that's on them and I really don't want to do it himself  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  it's been hard lately it's been probably hard for the last  going on a year  you know I I I  depends on my thought process at time I liked it I've been looking for work quite a bit so I was just wondering why you know I don't get called I I just have I have racing thoughts  so  or I get depressed you know cuz I are worried about things that you know that really I have no control over so you know  lately I just been sleeping too much for me because I was so used to just sleeping 4 to 5 hours a night too and now it's changed about 8 to 9 hours and I'm still tired  do you feel that way often lately I have them for about the last few months  what are you like when you don't sleep well tired  you know I don't sleep well you know that I just do all back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know I'm more of a guy and I love the work  and if I'm not then I just looked too much time for me to spend in my own head and so  you know  either I'll even if I'm busy I'm doing what I need to do know and whatever job I do like, you know get into it I enjoy it something new for me and  so I can think about you know either work or I can go home and then think about this you know I don't have to worry about no money  your bill is getting paid and I can just concentrate on other things either you know doing the things I like or maybe spending a little more time with my girlfriend or you know so  how do you cook with them  how do I cover them  I just  try not to think about it as it's not about what are coping with it or not I just do is  I'm a horrible guy that just  you know I may take me a moment to  to all  Salem cooking something but you know how it is if I have no control over it there's nothing that I can really do about it. One thing I can do is continue to do what I'm doing and that's actively looking for work. Going out on interviews talking with others about work so I can just come out and I'll get back to  back to basics you know I just don't like the loss of balme does bother me but I try not to  to let it continue bother me  yes  that got me a  if what has got me in trouble  my mood choice I mean  yeah money I mean my past I got a past history so which kind of tends to  ibobber my my hiring process I don't know them when I get hired so I got to do it a different different type of employers who are felony friendly and stuff like that and I tried you know I was out taking classes on now  oh not how to interview how to how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and  I got to reflect back on that but I just I got to keep putting in my head if that's not who who I want to be anymore so or you know I've done  I've done now  I've done my time so to say but I took the time you know the last time I just took a lot of time in and try to work on  the issues that were bothering me LOL  positive stuff I got my GED two different things to a lot of classes thought about going to school and going to school and  anything that would cause I change my old ways and and and try to move on to more productive activities  that's good  are you still in here  that  people have been deceitful  can you repeat that one more time  have you been diagnosed with depression been diagnosed with bipolar  how hard is that  stopping me don't you know  I don't medicate so I mean I have been on medication before in the past but  I guess I try to live on while I try to live life on life's terms and I just you know I know the medical establishment always want to label something in and what I don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills and I've been on probably every magical feel that there is for that and  you know how long I've been too strong or something that's coming up and so I just try to cope with things  which is my life skills you know I I don't I don't want to be using probably I know certain drugs work for like 3 to 4 months 6 months and they go load it while I'm going to try on this phone or I'm going to try on that and it's just an ongoing process tonight probably for about the last two years ask about three years I can kind of just said you know what that's it  and I  what are the difference in whether or if I would be on meds for it I don't think so you know it's just still the same stuff I still get the same problem can I still get the same anxiety that's if I if I was on medication for it or not so I just  and I'll deal with it you know sometimes it's not good and I get irritated at people a lot I don't like people I don't like crowds I don't like I'm not just people and empty quiet so  but I got a pretty nice not that I personality but I think people can see me and just say I don't mess with this guy or you know  but she'll you know I like I all right public transportation quite a bit and  now you just get a lot of loud I'm not just people on there sometimes I got to get off the bus that's how I deal with people because I just know there's consequences if I didn't deal with it that way. Go I'd rather take the time on get off the bus wait for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad  I understand  did you think you have a phone before you come back  did I have problem before I get out  well I don't know if I knew that I had a problem before I found out the thing is that I know other people  I have a lot of the same town so I know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when I told him that I was diagnosed with bipolar that  a lot of remorse for like all that's what you know that's what was wrong with you know we wish you that you would have found that out years ago  and like I said I don't think the meds really work but what I do I think time, I just getting older kind of makes it work  median with lights  how do you say therapist affected you  how do I talk to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while recently  and I don't want to get out my anger my thoughts  a lot of people other people may not understand  a therapist is  I think the biggest thing is that I can just get it all out whatever is problem it would be  people in Ohio  other issues you don't work or whatever the case maybe is that I just think talking about it and they're such good listener thinking, like  now that they give me the same advice I give myself or whatever that I would give to others but it's always helpful to hear from somebody else somebody who suppose we have to go to school for  I don't go anymore so I kind of miss it you know like I said  Miss Mulatto  I just one of those things you know I just deal with it you know according to let you know if I ever get a chance to go to therapy again.

in india and uh i was planning on uh bringing him here my dad's um i mean my brother said it's gonna be very expensive to um you know it's gonna be very expensive uh with respect to health bills and

parents not so close to <t> uh um with my brother and their family um it's the i mean like i tend to be judgmental and uh you know but i think sometimes that the my niece and nephew should have been brought brought up in a different way and uh you know uh and you know my <m> my brother doesn't seem to uh think along the same lines and um you know uh we have disagreements and mm you know that's the reason it is um no not at this time what do i think of what um can you can you repeat that one more time um and i still couldn't follow you okay no no uh yes about <bout> one to two years ago i was feeling down <d> uh down and i was not interested in things that i was <wa> that i was normally interested in  and uh you know i was sort of withdrawn and um the it was sh i was not able to focus on my things so i thought maybe i should go see a doctor and i ended up doing that uh no mm xxx i lost appetite i was not sleeping well and i i had difficulty um concentrating you know and focusing and uh i was not getting uh my assignments done on time uh these <the> these were some of the problems i been feeling good but uh no i don't i started doing yoga and uh you know i've been doing that for about a year and that's uh and meditation and that's helped a lot uh it's just that uh you know when i was diagnosed with uh depression i thought i shouldn't be taking any medication for it and i was looking at uh uh other ways to get over the problem and uh then i realized some of my friends were doing meditation and uh you know i got influenced by them uh it's a little difficult but uh of late i've been able to sleep uh within half an hour  there are days when it takes almost one two hours to uh go to sleep are they what can you repeat that uh no i just uh you know uh just switch off the light and uh you know keep tossing around and uh try to focus on things uh that makes me uh feel good and this and that um about <bout> three days ago what am i proud of uh i was in i i was among the top two percent in my m_b_a class and um and when i used to run my business i designed a product um that was uh working really well and uh i was happy that i was able to design something that was so useful for my business uh my my i'm thinking my friends would describe me as uh very friendly very easy to get along with  uh very focused uh very intelligent  and a good cook um albert einstein uh i mean some <so> some of some of some of his theories um you know it obviously it involves <inv> it involves a lot of deep thinking and uh the the first few times i read about him about his uh uh theories uh i had difficulty in um um really understanding that and uh that you know we it i mean when's when there when there are things that i really try to understand and i i'm not able to i and uh you know there are there are the type of people i admire listen to other people uh it's diverse um and i like the the entertainment industry  and uh i like uh yeah the fact that there are more women uh than men here <laughter> um uh there are certain areas where only spanish <spa> uh where only spanish is spoken uh you know i would like uh for all people who come to america to be able to understand english and be able to speak in english  so that everybody can participate um in l_a um i mean like i some of the things the political leaders uh do really makes me mad uh uh sometimes i think they're wasting their wasting their time our time and other countries are advancing  and um you know these <th> these guys don't get things done and you know i feel very bad about it and sometimes it makes me angry uh yeah i mean the first four years of uh obama administration i'd i think it was wasted because uh if the if congress had acted together uh eh got things done then uh you know we would <wou> mm maybe we could have uh you know uh made it much more difficult for china to catch up with us and you know the fact that china's able to do things and get things done much faster and these people still um you know uh argue and uh you know find <fi> uh find faults with each other and not get things done um you know they don't seem to realize that you know uh you know the clock keeps ticking you know they have to get things done um i mean like you know uh <laughter> one thing that comes to my mind is well you know i made a lot of money while uh you know once in los angeles uh and you know i thought it happened during christmas some ten years ago and uh that that made me very happy good music good food uh i mean the eh a party with friends that i like and uh and you know i also like cooking and i enjoy cooking with groups in groups uh those are things that really put me in a good mood um i'm very clean um i listen to people and i empathize uh try to solve their problems uh and i'm hoping they think i'm you know uh my advices and recommendations are uh worth um their time thank you so much you've been nice bye

421,female,1,10,doorbell back over here  alright great thank you  and please  are you okay with  yes that's fine  I'm okay how are you  originally I'm from San Francisco  originally I moved here in gosh 1995 then I went to Chicago then to San Francisco and then back to Los Angeles probably about 5 years ago  a lot of moving  never  there just isn't anything there for me anymore  the weather is better in LA but the people in San Francisco are nicer  my husband prefer my ex-husband prefers at here that's why we moved  okay  I have an undergraduate degree in Psychology and after that I went to law school  when I was in college I worked at a law firm and decided that I really wanted to be a lawyer it was really interesting  are you still working in that no now I'm a stay-at-home mom  you find it easy to be a parent know I loved it but it is it is difficult you have to manage a life to make sure that they become a good and successful person  it's easy to kind of do the academics and stuff like that you know I'm good at that the hardest thing I think is to guide them emotionally to help him through things that he's having a hard time with feeling like I don't have all the answers  I'm just seeing them grow and and experience new things and learn about life in the world it's just it's really really cool  what are some ways that your  completely different completely different and I am not a perfect parent but I love my son I take care of him he's the first priority in my life and they weren't like that at all  well my parents are dead I didn't speak to my dad at all before he died I have a sister and a brother that actually I don't know where they are I don't speak to them either  do you consider yourself more shy  probably more shy because I consider myself more reserved  I like to listen to music  like what I have I listen to all sorts of music but my favorite when I'm relaxing is that 80s music cheesy cheesy but true  it depends on who I'm with if I'm with my son I can control my temper if I'm with my ex-husband or other adults yeah I don't  so so  yesterday and it was about my ex-husband dating the woman that he was cheating on when we were married  can you tell me about that  I found out he was cheating on me and I kicked him out and he told me yesterday that he's continuing to date her  yeah  really angry  and just really hurt  I wish that I had talked to my dad before he died I wish that I had settled our differences before he had died  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to  the hardest decision I've ever had to make was actually ending my marriage  because he was cheating on me  that would have to be  well I don't know I mean I don't know if I'd want to erase anything from my memory because it makes me who I am today  but I can't really think of one event that I would want to erase  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep I don't get a good night sleep it's not easy I wake up a lot in the night  I don't know I wish I knew if I knew I could change it I could try to do something about it but I I just don't I don't know  what are you like when you don't  grumpy irritable  grumpy irritable down  mixed with anger  can you tell me about  it's just because of everything that I'm going through with my soon-to-be ex-husband  yeah there's  I just keep it inside  Meador Staffing else to really do except I mean it is what it is so  I have to  deal with it  no  yes  10 years ago after my son was born  9 years ago I felt like I couldn't cope with life  I was so down I couldn't I felt like I couldn't do anything  I need  no  I don't go to therapy I go to medication management but I don't do talk therapy  I have gone to a therapist and no they don't help  can you tell me if  well some just sit and stare at you and don't say anything you know if I wanted to talk to myself I would others give advice that I think is just  it just not not good and not on point  tell me about the last time you felt  it was probably this morning I was playing with my son  just really happy I wasn't thinking about  any of the other crap  in my life I could just forget it so I was feeling really really happy  I think they would describe me completely different from the way I would describe me but I think they would describe me as really sweet they have really sweet confident  outgoing because that's what I try to be two people so I think that's how they would describe me  I wish I wasn't sad I wish I was more confident  yeah there are a lot of things I think  it would be  to not  not give my life over to one particular person which is what I did with my husband  find your ideal weekend  I think I would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like Palm Springs with my son hanging around the pool having fun going out to dinner  one of my two of my friends to really good girlfriend so I think have been really positive influences in my life  can you tell me if  sure life is worse than mine and the but we can always commiserate together  is just really positive me she's always happy always up always look into the bright side so that has helped me a lot  my son  I went over to a friend's house and we had movie night we watch the grown up movie and had dinner and wine and the boys were in another room watching movies and playing video games and it was just a relaxed fun evening  thanks for sharing your thoughts with me  my  okay
386,female,0,11,"might have pulled something that  I'm going to bring the great thanks so much  and please  are you okay with this yes  oh I'm fine I'm a little tired but I found out my thyroid is I think acting up so  where are you from originally I was born in Canada  but I've lived in California most of my life so and it's gray today too so the gray weather makes you kind of see no sluggish  oh my gosh years and years ago  not at all I don't think I can text to her for a long time well the air fares have gone up quite a bit in the last few years gas prices have gone up so travel as much as it's a fun thing to do it's cost-prohibitive so  oh that's see everything has plus and minuses cold-weather not as much sun so I think I'd prefer getting more sun and having the warm-weather so but other than that it's it's very pretty back their natural scenery in but I like it here you know the traffic is kind of heavy but that's a small thing to deal with  why did I move to LA because my family came here and started to my dad got a job here and thus became our home base and  that's why  easy very easy sew  well in high school you generally study General Ed they have designated courses and then after that went to college and I was a business major let's say I was a Veterinary major and I graduated with a degree in Liberal Arts so  I don't know can't really pinpoint  I was working in Social Services but I've also worked in sales and most recently I'm doing real estate, leasing consultant part-time  I mean everything has plus and minuses it's it's okay it's not I don't really see too many negatives  oh probably to work as a gossip columnist it TMZ or one of those networks but as you know everything in the entertainment business is very competitive it's who you know so but that would be my dream job or probably working with cats you know animals  so  I'm very outgoing in fact I think I'm so echoing I scare people sometimes there's a lot of quiet you know Reserve people out there so I'm kind of East Coast very you know I go up to people and talk to them first social  sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver  oh my gosh there's I could do hundreds of things I could read I could watch a show turn on the music music is great take a walk call my friends  million things so  I'm pretty good I'm very good I mean you know of course when you're driving in LA and somebody cuts in front of you sometimes I can be irritating but I'm I'm actually pretty I'm not the type of person that will fighter jet I don't like to have confrontations so  I can't really remember so that's why I said there's not very many arguments usually I avoid arguments at any cost so  do you feel guilty about  I don't really feel guilty about anything right now or that I can think of  I can't think of anything right now  I really can't think of any decisions that were really hard I mean most of it's pretty easy for make me to make a decision so I don't have a family so if I have to you know I had to moves to San Francisco for a job once but since I'm single it's I don't really have to consider other people and children and that type of thing so kind of makes certain things easier when you don't have other family to consider  yeah  in advance  well obviously you don't you know the passing of a family member you know you wish everybody could be around forever so I know when my father died you know I mean I wish I would have had him for a lot longer and he died at the age of 77 and you know what have been nice to have him around a little bit more  but you know I can't control those things life has its own way of dealing with that  yes there are Yin and Yang that's ancient philosophy and it really applies here is pluses and minuses the negatives and positives so  well like I said my dad's no longer here and my mother and I you know we have our differences I think mothers and daughters always do my brother and I get along great I see him a lot my sister works a lot I see her and you know we talked and she's kind of got her own life and her children I get along great with them so  we have a small family  once again it's like that's a hard question to answer there's so many types of kids up there I think majority of them seem to be pretty well-behaved I mean you know there's always going to be children that are cut out of control but I don't know the ones that I've seen recently the very well behaved so can't say much else about that  well I live in an apartment and I don't know if you've ever lived in apartment but there's someone that lives above me I'm on the first floor and there's somebody on the second floor and they're pretty quiet but they have a habit of I guess they have lots of energy they usually will take their showers around midnight and sometimes I'll start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes run through the bedroom wall so it sounds like Niagara Falls and they are and so I don't ya and I need 8 hours of sleep and I've only been getting oh I'd say like maybe 6 hours and then I usually wake up once at night take a sometimes they'll kind of around 2 or 3 in the morning go either walk around or I'll hear something so I'm not getting a straight 8 hours of sleep and it's definitely but there's not like I said there's things you can't control when you live in an apartment you know I means that the ladies look very quiet it  just that she has a habit of you know taking later showers question close at night that's I can't say anything to her about that  yeah but you know there's people that are in worse situations so I don't make a lot out of it you know and I just it's not like every night but it's you know at least twice a week so you know I have to consider sleeping in another room but for now you know that's I'll deal with it so  tired very tired and hard to focus hard to concentrate it just takes me longer to get things done cuz I don't have my energy also I haven't been exercising I normally try to walk about half an hour a day but the weather's been kind of colder and kind of dreary or so you know I'm not as motivated when the weather is kind of blah so it's a combination of both not getting my exercise not getting 8 hours sleep  how you been feeling lately  as I said before tire has a combination of the weather you know I'm here in Los Angeles right now we have been having very gray days I live very close to the ocean so the sun doesn't come out that much so I'm not getting my serotonin I need that I am I getting my 8 hours of sleep because you know whatever and I think my thyroid is acting up too so that's kind of creating you know I have some vitamin deficiencies and you know once the Sun comes out I'm kind of more energetic it just gives you that more energy  have you ever been diagnosed with p  no  no  I hope I'm happy most of the time I'm a pretty happy person and I like to be around other people I mean of course I like my private time but I do like being around people quite a bit so  can't think of anything right now I mean I usually enjoy everything I do there's nothing that stands out more than anything else  okay  is there anything you regret know I never regret anything  what advice would I have given well I guess yeah I could probably change things around I think it everybody could I probably would have had a different college major in a seems like  what else I probably wouldn't have dated certain waste of time with certain people  I don't know those are them things that come to mind  maybe started saving money earlier you know those types of things  but  how your best friend in Spanish  outgoing lots of fun to be with just a good friend to have people like having me for a friend I'm loyal trusting and  I listen I'm a good listener I'm very patient as well so  what are some things you wish you could change about yourself  well I never wanted me to lose weight but I think that's a worldwide problem I mean there's a lot of food around and temptations and especially here in America a lot of us are couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we  you know it's just easy to real it's so easy to relax you know it's hard to get up and move around you have to talk yourself into it so that's the way that you know house gives you more energy to if you lose weight so that's a big thing as well but that's probably the thing just the weight thing you  I understand  how do your best friend describe you I think you might have asked me that question before her  but if you want I'll repeat it so  I'm very like I said I'm very loyal when I tell people I'm going to do something I do it very reliable I am warm I'm very friendly great listener and I mean I've heard so many people tell me they just like being with me so like I said I'm very I'm pretty upbeat you know I'm don't let things get me down too much so  how have in your life  that's a hard question that can't think I mean I'm  can't think of the answer that way so  4fun well I love movies so I could see every movie that they make I love going out with my friends shopping swap meets my gosh and traveling is great road trips  that's kind of  we know part of it yeah that I mentioned so  traveling getting to see different places the history aspect of it the foods and joined Foods in different countries the architecture it's just kind of need to get away and see a completely different place  okay well I've been to a lot of places in Europe I love Paris is such a walking City you can whoever designed that City I'll tell you I mean it's you can get from one point to another the Subways are great  each area has its own distinctive kind of there's the Latin quarter where the students are there is another area where let's say the fashion designers are kind of like our Rodeo Drive here in Beverly Hills there's an area that is more African and they have swap meets in the weekends that are wonderful is for international  and then like I said when she get out of Paris there's just so much history you can go see Versailles there's other palaces you can go to the south of France you know  but that's probably my favorite country I've been to Italy as well so  yeah well after college people usually many people that go to college or either before or after college that's a great time to go to Europe because you're young and you're not tied down you don't have a family and you kind of have a more adventuresome Spirit you got more energy so carrying you know backpack or suitcases it's not not a big deal so yeah that's  thank you goodbye  oh that was that was fast  but I didn't never said there wasn't any like shocking question  never know I guess"
453,male,1,17,hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today yes  Los Angeles  convenience convenience  people the crowd  traffic  people that lack of respect  locally originally  meeting old people I love talking old people  I work a lot with my elders in my reservation and other reservations here in California and I spend a lot of time with her with the elders I talked with them and they helped me out of  Target are good stories  going in the mountains and seeing waterfalls then no one else is saying except for my people and I was the most beautiful thing I think I found  it depends on the situation if I'm if somebody comes to me looking for me to help them I take control it if I need help with its I work at asking for help so it depends on the situation  I Garden  and I think  very good.  3 days ago it was about communication and the lack of communication on the other person's part and I needed them to communicate better so that way I could understand and they didn't communicate so we had an argument and I got to settle  I felt I'm caught off guard because this is an individual that I spend pretty much almost every minute of my day with and to not be told what was going on in this person's head and then to have a situation arise and I was kept out I didn't like that  I got a pass  probably lack of time spent with my grandparents  just wanted on you regret that you didn't miss time with spend time with me  I want thing I truly wish I could remember I was I was a professional athlete and what time I have party till like 4 in the morning and then I had did my event at like 10 in the morning and I was my captain and I'm very smile team  that's one thing I truly believe that  are the professional fighter soon  yeah I'm not party. About other people besides myself  I studied massage therapy and Nursing degree  a lot of it's just been on job education  I'm very  I'll get to my own injuries I just going through the therapy process and believing in people and seeing how it worked and I decided to do that I wanted to help people too  are you happy  oh yeah  yes  I want to paint that's all I want to do is just paint  I have two sons and it's time for me to the move on and they're older and they can take care of themselves now so many leaving the area where my sons are sweetheart  the reflection of you  play reflection of you a mind you so much about yourself Who You Are  consistency even when you're sick  I don't assume my kids are right around by listen to him first and then make my decisions after that and I try not to come from an emotional hiding place but I think logically and I put myself in their place before I do it we discuss we communicate happy in my family cuz that's the only way we get along with each other through communication  communicate  my family is severed pretty much so my family my relationship with my family on the reservation is very tight and the rest of the family were all fragmented scattered around the Southwest so it's not very tight at all  I have too many to count  start with my uncle my uncle was like my dad. Me to go away  he watched out for me he told me he taught me hard work at a very young age he also taught me to protect my family  Tommy honor. Me Love  it's a good man  how easy is it for you to get a good night  I don't lie ever had a good night sleep in years so I have to get broken sleep  are dreams the dreams you come through real  get up and go to the bathroom and go back to sleep  my years of fighting and just got up to me  reserved  reserved and I try to find things to distract my brain to think of different ways of doing things  I got rid of TV about 8 months ago so I got rid of that distraction so what I do now is ready to paint a garden or cleaning house washing dishes or get out the walk that's nothing to do a lot of walking out is  anxiety anxious  my anxieties  habits good I have techniques to bring myself down  nothing new  out of the normal  yes  3 years ago around 3  insomnia issues  it was about  2 years ago around there to look it over two years ago I was released from therapy  off the therapist Release Me  what I noticed is I still deal with pictures and emotions  what would I do is now if I really practice hard at taking care of myself and then getting to those places to things that  strike me give me anxious or excited or angry I learn how to work out of it and realize it's not real it's not real  that's just the emotion it's not real so these are the things like no manches and I tell myself and this is really helped me a lot from therapy because it taught me that those emotions and pictures truly aren't real  and that's the therapies helped a lot that mean it's just a change my world  if  around the same time as the PTSD  after years ago  in my dreams when I dream I do  last night  I just dreaming of fighting and then in preparing fighters to fight I wasn't nothing to I build up anxiety dreaming about preparing fighters to fight and then stepping in front of thousands of people and then I always end up fighting in my dreams so it's always what gets me scared in all my dreams is that I should have made the move and finish the fight and I didn't  and so builds anxiety and stressing me that I tend to act out in my sleep  I was real like I was there right like I smell taste feel everything their house there  on this morning driving here talking to my girlfriend  trustworthy  he loves me I love him he's more best friends  a 02 change  I can recall  okay  I got it  just not spending time with my grandparents and in  I think they today issues maybe you know a couple here there that I should have went to the store first or something like that but I mean it's nothing like that  quit thinking you know it all  my loyalty  my trustworthiness  the new art project yesterday  nice  where is Santa Barbara from the film some rocks and some old rock song Someone that made by loving just threw a dump old rocks out of the way and it went through the pile of rocks and I found the soul rock that was in the middle of it and then took a home and now I'm doing art piece on it and for me it was like the thing was totally forgotten about was just considered a rock and now they're sure you'll be sitting in my grand kids table and let's just give me a call like that  what are you most proud of in your life  start starting something that I'm so bad at  then I don't think there's no way I can be good at it and all sudden I get to be better at it so I don't even have to think about it just so good at it that way I could just touch it and feel it and then I think about it these are the things I'm proud of like I like that I like that  accomplishment I guess you can say  her her left clavicle needs adjustment  her clavicle set tired makes it look like she's been in a car accident and she's like this sheet her left shoulder is up higher and it's question so you're off and it's drawing my attention to that so I don't know if you guys noticed that to the other part of it too is the hand motions that she does some of the hand motions are very aggressive in it and wakes it was very distracting in the beginning because she was like  fast moving like my therapist cuz we working with the PTSD issues he that he did everything slowly cuz I said off on quick trigger movements and so like with her hand movements like that. Like this talkin it was distracting in the beginning but besides that everything is just like it's pretty amazing computer but it's and you feel comfortable that is a good thing  yeah yeah
363,male,0,0,okay great so everything's all set up now okay  okay  sorry about that.  want to give me one second I'll be right back okay  that's okay  user  we have this  yeah course  so that's all right so just keep going so I'm going to  something for our purposes after I start  kind of spooky  okay  hi I'm Ali  created to talk to people in the states  and please  are you okay with this yes  good how are you  I am from Los Angeles  yes  it's the center of everything that you can get to all the places you need to go to without having to drive very far I like being in the city  well meaning la also you're dealing with traffic a lot of congestion and obviously the environment as far as the air quality is not that great but you know you live with that  why was a business administration major so I studied business and after I finish college I am pursued a career in retail operations  are you still doing that I know as a matter of fact I am not a kind of changed career over the last four or five years so I'm concentrating more on the human resources side of the business  a couple of factors after working a new Mercy years in the retail business I switched over and worked in a creative business which is a graphic design firm and I captured her now a lot of knowledge in the in the Human Resources side because I was the operations manager / benefits manager for a small company  are you happy  yes I'm very happy I did that I picked up a lot of knowledge and and is very helpful  I love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me  well my dream job is  I'm basically kind of doing what I want to do now because I am a independent contractor I do freelance work as an HR consultant using all the knowledge that I gained from previous jobs and I utilize that with the flexibility to do the things I want to do as far as personally and have the time I needed to do the things I want and obviously I worked hard early part of my career so the financial aspect of my retirement is already set in place so I do what I need to do as far as maintaining a certain lifestyle but also I have I also enjoy what I do I'm not under as much stress as I used to be  I'm not well I'm not totally outgoing but I'm not I'm not extremely shy I'm probably right in the middle may be more towards outgoing but I'm not totally out going I mean when I'm around other people I am in a social situation that I guess you could consider me right now going person but obviously I do have my own little private issues that I keep to myself  can you tell me about  oh sure you know I have  couple years ago I had a heart attack and I had had bypass operation and it had it had to do with stress and things like that I don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me if I meet someone new I don't just openly say well you know I've experienced this this and this so I just basically if it comes up I won't deny it or if it comes up and it's a if it I feel like it's something to talk about I will talk about it  sometimes when I'm feeling 10  hey I know it's not Hawaii  actually my relaxation is I'm currently living with my mom my mother and she's a senior citizen and she's alone so what I do for relaxation or to relieve stress is actually help her do yard work take care of all the gardening and things like that and that's actually very therapeutic  I'm not thumb  shortfuse kind of person it takes a lot to get me really angry so as far as my temper is concerned there's not there's not much to that  I'm trying to think here I can't recall when the last time it was but it was probably last year sometime when I had a creditor that I was dealing with being very difficult to work with and I owed money as far as some medical expenses that were incurred when I had my heart attack a few years ago and they weren't very understanding of the situation and I I I really got a little upset about that because I felt like I was being honest with them and I was I was more than willing to take care of my issues but they were playing Hardball and I didn't care for that  it does  probably the hardest decision I ever had to make was  it had to do with a life-and-death situation with my my stepfather who is battling prostate cancer and making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was going to either help him or there's a slight chance of going to help him even though he's pretty terminal at that point or it would it would kill him you know and that was really tough it was really tough decision to make but you know I felt like if I didn't try and see if we could save his will help save his life or if it we didn't take a chance and then take that extra step that I would regret it in the long run  it is I was  well right now I'm separated from my wife so she has her issues I have my issues but we are not divorced we are just separated and we still have a relationship where we still speak to each other we just don't live together  and the relationship with my mother is really great you know she's very understanding I'm an only child so she likes having me around which is good because she's in her late and she's in a later stage of her life she's 82 years old and and so she needs to I guess it's good that end in its own way maybe fate is taking place because you know someone 82 years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing but with me there I think she should do the Comfort level she feels with me there especially being her only child  something you feel guilty about  probably the most guilty I feel about anything you are the things that I did to hurt my marriage as far as  the things that I did the selfishness that I did when I was much younger that obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife  yeah I am  got caught up in a situation where I was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lot of stress my wife was also working a lot of hours in a job that she had and that we were growing apart and when she was away my form of release was to go to the casinos and Gamble and so you know I spent a lot of time in the casinos and what eventually happened was I spend a lot of money and always see that was a major issue regarding our relationship had to do a trust because I'm  and it was devastating to my wife  I felt what weight when it came to light I felt very guilty and I felt less than a human being at that point in my life  no not at all  diagnosed with depression no not really no  how easy is it for  I don't have problems sleeping that's why I don't ever recall having any problems sleeping so no  no not at all  no I will I just don't think I could say is  after I had my heart attack a few years ago I don't let I find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before so I tend to be a little bit more easygoing and my friends and family have noticed that  tell me about the last time you saw  the last time I felt really happy  probably when I had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack and he basically said to me that after many tasks and many months of Rehabilitation that he was happy to explain to me that there was no Scar Tissue no major scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart heart attack and that I could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as I watch my diet and took my medications  what are some things you wish you could change about  well I guess number one thing is  my physical being itself I like to be a little bit more healthy or lose some more weight just in general just be more healthier physically and as far as mentally just not go back to the old ways of thinking where I was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish  just one day at a time you know I just try to be at peace with myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis I meditate I read you know I read some books I watch TV I do things that I know that if I can I get if I can help myself I do things to help myself  there's a lot that I regret obviously in my marriage my working career as far as I had a long career with this Majors food chain in and I basically because of my gambling issues I ended up ruining a very good career but  at this point right now there's not much I can do I can't change what's been done so I don't Focus too much on the past I just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me everyday  what advice wake up and and see what you're doing to yourself and you know make the changes you need to be changed you know you know I'm not a  I'm not someone that's not intelligent but I was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong and  yet what you doing is wrong you need to change your behavior immediately  probably  the proud what I'm proud about overalls the fact that I did all these awful things but deep down I don't think as a person I'm a bad person I have to remember that when I was caught up in all the gambling in compulsive Behavior it was because I had an illness of compulsive obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill and that I was a sick person just trying to become healthy and every day that's what my life is about it's about recovery and just making sure that I do the right things from the time I wake up in the morning to the time I go to sleep at night  one day at a time  it's not as hard as you think it's but it is a process where you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines and just know that what's not right for you and I could be okay for other people to do certain things but I cannot do those things anymore  how do your best friend describe  what's my best friends can describe me as probably easygoing generous a nice person to be around and  you know  they were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues related to the gambling and the and the breakup breakup of my marriage which you know it's still not over yet you know  well my ideal weekend starts off usually after I have breakfast with my mother early in the morning like around 6 I go to a local park and it's about this park is probably lay down where you can walk up a hill and down a hill it's about three and a half miles and I take a brisk walk in the morning get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going and then after that I am  can I go home work in the yard a few hours take a shower and relax and then just kind of kick back for the rest of the day and then the next day I I do the same thing again in the morning I have to go for a walk work out in the yard watch TV whatever just relax that's how we can goes for me  thank you  bye  lock yourself out  okay  kind of like I actually got comfortable talking to
458,female,0,5,so you guys are controlling the virtual human okay yes  I'm doing fine thank you  I'm from Los Angeles California yes  I love man saying I like the weather I like the lifestyle I like the variety of beach know we have it all  things I don't like about La the rent is way way way way too expensive it's ridiculous  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes  I have I'm well-travelled  nice  enjoy.  I enjoy seeing new places going new places it's different every where the people are different  it's fun  okay well the most recent is last year I went to family reunions in New Orleans so that was in June and while I was there we also visited Slidell Louisiana for the the swamp tours and Vicksburg Mississippi where my mom is from and we spent the night in Ferriday Louisiana with my aunt to will be 101 this year in May  there's a lot as far as traveling or just.  Most memorable experience and well I don't know if it's just one probably when  I used to travel with my dad that's where I got a lot of my traveling from  can you tell me about  yeah it was best car sometimes planes mostly white just I guess I'll say mostly down south but it was really fun especially the road trips  just a general and also drama  what's your dream job  my dream job is to become a real estate investor  well I've sort of really been into it every since 2005 I just don't have the capital right now or the connections but since I do like real estate I'm just going to start off as a real estate agent so I should have my license sometime this year  outgoing  I'm well I'm not sure why it could be a little bit of both but I'm pretty outgoing  well speaking of Hawaii I did live there for a year and a half but what do I do to relax is either I'm usually take a nap take a bath  or just try to get things off of my mind and try to spend my energy in more positive ways  it needs to be worked on but I know when to control it when I need to  well me and my ex-husband still get into arguments is this just over a text message but I'm actually it was my fault but usually it's his but it just starts little and kind of snowballs out of control butt  that's usually how it goes  well I don't know what else to do except for pray on it because I thought once I moved into another house it would be over but I see that we're still getting into it so I don't know maybe ignore it or if he wants to be right than them be right I guess  probably quite a few things but I don't regret anything I've done in my life but  situation I wish I would have handled differently just  kind of everything in my life almost I could have done it differently or I would if I had the chance but I'm not worried about it cuz I don't regret anything that I've done in my life  tell me about  the hardest decision probably when I had to get a divorce that that may have been the hardest a one of the hardest decisions  it was just a lot of a lot of stuff through the years the relationship is kind of deteriorated the relationship between us was still good then the things that he were doing I would have been able to overlook it a little bit more because I would feel like well our relationship is good and it's difficult to find a really really good relationship but since our relationship deteriorated and there's just a lot of disagreement and arguing and problems financial problems and he's doing this so I  I just decided just forget it I mean I tried but you know he didn't want to cooperate so  well I'm happy with what's going on now I mean I wish that we could still be a family but since that's not going to happen yes I am happy with my life right now yes  something I can erase  I don't think I really need to erase anyting I finally got an over the way the kids treated me at school but other than that I can't think of anything to erase  it's fair / good there is no problems right now so I guess I'll just say good yeah there's no problem  well I would have to say my mother yes  I'm with she's just always supported me and everything that I've done whether it's good or not so good so I think that's a blessing  sometime sometime it's not  well I just don't get enough hours of sleep I guess that's what it is cuz I would like to sometimes so that's more the problem I would like to get  I'm just sleepy yeah sleepy tired feeling like I want to go take a nap  I've been feeling fine  I know they've been about the same  have you ever been  no  no  I'm really happy probably last week because I got over to a little bit of money so  well I guess my best friend will be my mom or maybe my entertainment friend that I've been knowing since 96 I really wouldn't I'm not going to say I don't consider him a best friend that we don't really hang out that much but he is very ungenerous to me and my mom  so  well right now I spend my weekends doing chores and classwork and sleeping in  but maybe after the class work is out of the way maybe I could do something else  myself well I do wish that at times I could control my temper a little more and of course I would like to lose weight be a little bit more active and I wish my skin would clear up  it was probably when I was in school school years or terrible for a lot of people because the kids are animals so they try to make you feel like you're nothing like your piece of turd on to their foot so that's probably the last time is an adult now  I would say that I'm genuine I'm honest I'm supportive  and I'm just a good friend  no  did you give yourself  well 20 years ago just because you're pregnant that doesn't mean that you're eating for two and you can eat loads of food like people tell you that's the main thing I'm I'm going to tell my daughter's no I'm just eat as you normally eat the eat more healthier there's no need to gain 80 lb when the baby is just 20 pounds or less and you have all this weight to lose also know if I came into any money now 20 years ago I was probably just thinking about shopping or just kind of spending it on frivolous stuff where is now I would invest it  so yeah I think that's about it  proud of  I guess maybe myself my kids  hey thank you  bye
406,female,0,2,okay  hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today  creative  are you okay with this yes  I'm doing good  I'm originally from Southern California  I like the downtown Theater District I like the beaches I I like the variety of stuff that you can do in one day  well sometimes I don't like the traffic I don't think there's really too much I don't like about La I really like it like that oh  no I haven't really travel in about 5 years  oh I just haven't been able to travel  I just haven't travel  I like going to new places and seeing things I haven't seen before and if I can like visiting places like landmarks  I want to hear that one of your trips  well the last one I did was San Francisco that wasn't so far but I got to stay in downtown San Francisco and I got to go shopping and I got to get on him the streetcar so that was cool  well I still study I'm studying psychology  well  I decided to go back to school just pretty quickly so I went to Junior College and then when it got close to graduate I knew I want to transfer so  I taking a couple psychology course is not decided I liked it so I just decide to make that my major and I thought I didn't have a lot of math but it had enough math  are you happy  well now that I'm almost done I don't know if I'm going to continue in that area  dream job  well would I wanted initially was to get in the sport psychology but I'm not quite sure that's what I want either  okay  you consider yourself more shy or outgoing  well I have to be shy initially but once you get to know me I'm outgoing  what I'm feeling  I turn on the fish tank screensaver I think I either go to sleep eat something really really good or watch something on Netflix  like what what does a good movie I like four movies a lot so a lot of right now I'm into martial arts movie with subtitles so  I think I'm pretty good  when was the  you know I know  they're not really long arguments I don't know if there were arguments I know I argue with my boyfriend and he hung up for my face so I don't know why and it got soft pretty quickly so I don't know if it was really that important  when I walked out without saying okay  I can't think of one right now  I think  the hardest decision I probably had to make was moving from will back to California from Oregon  can you tell me about that  but I was really young so I was  19/20 and I was really by myself so that was pretty hard cuz I obviously had to support myself  what made you decide to do that because it was a really really boring in Oregon so I really like the activity here in LA  what's something you feel guilty about  you know I don't really feel guilty about many things  okay  tell me about your relationship with your family  well I don't talk to them that much my dad and my stepmom live in Oregon so I probably talked to on the phone at least once or twice a month and then when I come out here I want to say at least once a year sometimes you can be twice you know occasionally more but not too often and I see them about it but I'm pretty much the only one out here my brother is also up there as well yeah  what have lots of positive influences I think I'm just regular people are come across you know maybe someone off work with maybe I'll actually my uncle he's a really good positive but he knows quite a bit has lots of good advice  like what about life  you know I don't really think I've had anything that bad happen to me where I just don't  what bothers me so much I have to not think about it  well I can't say pretty easy cuz I work schedule and then I go to school but  I want to go to sleep I sleep really well those long as I have enough you know hours  feeling lately really really happy and good  nope  no  always happy hour yesterday  I'm just happy anytime I talk to my boyfriend or if I go out and do something I'm just happy I got off work I'm happy cuz I'm done for the day I'm just really happy I'm on spring break I'm really happy right now so  awesome  something you did read  oh I haven't done like any really extremely fun activities unless you consider going out to eat but the last activity that I had a lot of fun doing with ice skating in December 10th in downtown LA  is there anything you regret know I don't really have too many regrets I mean whatever happens happens and you know was meant to play out that way  advice cuz you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  well  I guess I would say don't worry too much about the small things  even though they seem really big it really they really are insignificant and you won't think about it in 6 months from now  okay  I think my best qualities are I'm a happy person I'm a fun person I'm pretty easy to get along with I think most people like me and I'm just a cool person  well I wish I could study more I wish I would study more I wish that I would exercise more and I wish that I think that's it right there  tell me about  I don't think I want to talk about that  okay  what are you most proud of in your life  I don't know I guess I'm just taking care of myself supporting myself not having to go back home I guess that's about the best accomplishment there is  thank you  bye  okay is that you and the other end  all right so you can move back over to that computer will have you do a quick phone service
377,female,1,16,"so when she's finished I'll just wait for a little more buttons not working I'm pleased  are you okay  yeah go ahead  okay  I grew up in Wisconsin and I lived in Colorado for a bit and then they lived overseas for a little while and then I move to California  I moved here at the end of June of last year so I guess it's been 8 months something like that  at the most probably twice a year  Well my own town is all of 5,000 people and there are a lot of cows and barns and Farms so the opposite of LA  good question I have always wanted to live in California so but I had to living in in the Central Coast  and I just have been coming down to La like once a month for different business and that working and personal development stuff so yeah things were changing in Santa Cruz for me that client I had who is really the main like Financial  Main Financial Source I had that relationship ended so I was totally free to move and I thought well I guess I'll give Ally a try and see what happens so  I give it a shot and here I am  no not at all very very big city  I lived in Dublin in Ireland was it which is also a big city but you know European cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy and  yeah so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging and  I'm not much of a world Explorer. I love to travel I love it I live in Ireland and I traveled by the Morocco and I was in Costa Rica on my spend some time in Mexico so yeah  I love meeting new people experiencing new cultures and like also not just seeing what's different but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go  I want to hear about one of your trips  sure well  I guess trying to think which is my favorite time of night there's amazing things about Morocco and Costa Rica both but Morocco's incredible it was like 12 days and we went to three different locations we went up in the atlas mountains are beautiful and  yeah it's a really really cool culture that was fun  my trip to Ireland I actually visited there which is why I decided to move there so my most memorable moment of that trip probably dozens but the first most memorable moment of that trip was being in a bison and leaving Dublin and going to sound to the countryside and seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is time is everyone is these pictures of Ireland or you know you see in films and it's green and Lush and gorgeous but you actually get there and experienced it it's like the pictures don't do it justice so incredible  I might have an undergrad degree in English and psychology and a psychology minor and I have a master's degree in women's studies  no I use my English in Psychology I work in marketing Communications so actually do sales so yeah the psychology definitely comes in to comes into play and so does my  I guess my undergrad degree in English but really like I took that on and and created something out of it because most people who get an English degree just teach and I I wasn't wanting to teach  what made you decide to do  too cuz I'm not clear on the question  okay  my job  wow  yeah my dream job is  being a  a motivational speaker and trainer and coach  I'm in traveling the world doing that and impacting people's lives and really contributing to people  my relationships pretty good actually I  I just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who would not she was sporadic I saw her sporadically growing up I lived my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and they had two kids together so I grew up and I consider them like the family I grew up with so but I got in communication with my biological mother  last May and we've been  clear things up and have been in communication since then  well not sure what you mean but if you're referring to being communication with my birth mother is very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and they do not just the future but in the present moment with her so yeah  I'm shy  time to relax I do a number of things I like to do yoga and I don't have the money for it right now I love to dance I love to read I love to go to the ocean and spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions that really retarded is my battery actually probably more than anything else  I like to be with friends I love arts and trying new restaurants  yeah all those things are  both relaxing and I guess they're relaxing in the sense that I feel connected to the people in my life and today experiences of my life so  yeah  how are you at controlling your temper  depends if I'm driving not very good but otherwise I'm pretty good at it  last night I argued with somebody probably would have to be  Ono is with the LA times that the newspaper delivery  yeah that was the last time  tell me about  yeah the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that I take care of it didn't show up and I didn't realize that it wasn't there until  I'm late I don't know afternoon I think early afternoon and then I called them and they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after 10:30 in the morning which is absurd to me when they made a mistake in the first place so I mean for service at and it would pay for it for every day so I'm yeah I was just really irritated and then I found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so amazing Ricky L E X I was angry with people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me I was pretty frustrated  Noel there quite a few of those  I think about 1  the other day I had a phone call  and I'm going to coaching program and  it was from one of the coaches in the program and she was explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls cuz we have one particular coach we work with and then she called to tell me that I was going to have another coaching call with  someone who's not my couch and that hasn't been explained to me it's part of the program so it's in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my God I have all these people I have to be accountable to and you know I have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just  so yeah I wasn't  I was an angry I was just I just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and I talked it out with her and we got through it but  yeah I could have  certainly just been okay with what for was being asked of me in the at that time and would have made the call go a lot smoother  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make  large decision while there's been a few  why is moving to Ireland was probably the hardest decision now it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was challenging  that was the hardest decision was the first time that I  moved away from my family I was 28 and I decided to I chose to move to Colorado and that's a pretty tough decision at that point my family had been within an hour's Drive of where I lived an hour hour-and-a-half and now they're going to be a 12-hour drive away or a plane right away so that was challenging  oh lots of things  I love Colorado Colorado is beautiful beautiful state and the weather is so much better than Wisconsin and at the time I was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor outdoor community in Colorado so they were a lot more people who were in my age group and or single that was another factor and we're interested in the things I was interested in so Colorado to seem like a really natural fit hell yeah and then I found a job that I liked the pay was atrocious but I found some work that was really rewarding and that all came together just move  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  I was totally unrelated question  relatively easily it just depends on like what time I go to sleep if I'm out and I don't get home until 11:30 then  and having to go to bed late and I wake up feeling tired like I feel today but generally I can sleep through the night I've had some pretty anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks but even so even when I wake up from those are five-star from those I still can fall back to sleep relatively easily  I'm sure they are I mean I'm in another transition state and moving out of  out of the house that I live in right now or take care of an elderly woman  yeah and I just I have to find  the financial means to support me in doing that and it's and she creates a lot of anxiety just didn't her state of being anxious exhausting and I'd really depressing  living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing I've ever done and I would never ever choose to do it again if I honestly if I knew what I was getting into I don't think I would have said yes to the situation  I feel trapped and helpless like this nothing I can  no way out of the situation that I'm in no matter what I do it doesn't get any better I did I don't know I'm not getting any kind of work that I want to do and my money's not working at all  so yeah I feel pretty crappy  I have in the past year  oh a long time I was 15 I think 14 so it was over 20 years ago  are you suicidal  you feel down  oh yeah I fell down  I don't actually now  well I originally stopped  with my therapist because we had completed I mean we had worked on what needed to be worked on and I was no longer depressed and and then I began therapy again later on think I wish it was in my early thirties and then I we ended that because I moved to Ireland so  yeah I'm in depending on the therapist and sitting on your intention like I I don't go into therapy thinking I'm going to be in this therapeutic relationship for the next 10 years I think that's ridiculous  I think you going to therapy to work on a specific problem and I have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board you can see things that you can't see and  we not work through that situation and come up with  a strategy for notches that not just in creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies and tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever  tell me about the last time you got  can I feel really happy  Zoe Sierra go  no that's not true it was when I  saw my biological mother which was last May  my best qualities  I'm very strong  very strong-willed  I  very supportive and loving and nurturing I'm easy to be around I'm intelligence  and  is there anything you regret  I don't think so  now  what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  don't take life too seriously  how ideal weekend, spend some time at the beach and spend some time with friends  either going out at night you know to a movie or just going out to  a club or bar somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together maybe go dancing after and Sundays I usually go to  and then I have brunch with friends and  may I go home and Sunday night and get ready for the next day so  I am most proud of  a few things that mean I've moved to places that I wanted to move to and so I've done things that have really spoken to me and if meant something been dear to my heart to actually  achieve those those  goals are those  yeah I've done things that I wanted to do like move to Ireland and move to California  okay"
442,male,0,6,<sync> sure in a day uh pretty well except for drab weather originally i'm from detroit michigan yes uh back in the eighties yeah uh it's been a while the last time uh it's been about five years <laughter> uh not even close uh <sigh> more setback uh out here it's you know you have the weather that's that's that's prominent <pr> prominent reason for coming is the weather it does uh well maybe better opportunities uh and the weather <laughter> yes <sigh> it took a minute uh had to adjust to <tisk> the uh different attitudes of the people the surroundings the locations and the vast area that someone had to cover to get to one spot to another um well the weather uh for one the never end uh uh uh it never snows in in southern california uh two uh the prospects of uh uh starting out a business or becoming uh self-employed and doing what i like to do the people they're not friendly for no no one's friendly out here you know uh back east and i'm from uh i was raised in the south where everybody is uh cordial friendly hi when you pass in the streets out here people think that you have uh uh some agenda just for saying hello in passing so that's what i don't like about l_a used to uh i used to be on the road a lot i was a a truck driver and plus uh a entertainment uh coach driver for several uh motown bands back in the day so yeah so i'm used to traveling yes yeah well this is a beautiful <beau> this is actually a beautiful country so just viewing uh uh the countryside uh visiting different towns different cultures uh different towns uh and seeing how basically how the rest of the uh the country uh uh lives uh some not so good some bad uh and some good um let's see denver colorado i lived in denver for a couple years which is uh really a great uh uh city uh and then i lived in uh atlanta which is uh uh really a great state where is you know you have the southern attitude <a> a southern attitude southern attitude which is everybody's friendly and gets along and and let's see i've been back and forth across this country at least sixteen to twenty times so yeah it's it's been it's been it's been an adventure <laughter> uh arkansas little rock where i had to get into a uh you might wanna say a a altercation with the rednecks down there because as as you know um i'm african american and down there they're very prejudiced you know they're the uh uh southern uh uh uh which what were the rebels uh not rebels but uh what were they uh confederates they still have this uh uh tendency of thinking blacks or any other culture besides whites aren't uh valuable people yeah so it i had a incident down there where it actually turned into a shoot out but i'm okay a little of both it it depends on it depends on the time on the period it depends on what mood i'm in at the time you know i can be outgoing 'cause i do uh like to go to  nightclubs and listen to live music live bands and i know like i said i uh i did some entertainment before so at clubs i'm more outgoing in social events more shy <laughter> meditate very good very good because uh if i let my temper get the best of me i uh tend to um cause more harm than good you know uh harm to the person harm to myself by you know uh physical altercations or um going to jail and so yeah i'm very good at uh controlling my emotions my temper good question uh okay girlfriend <laughter> uh we just recently broke up about two three weeks ago because of a argument about what she thought she could do and what i know she couldn't do and she wanted to do it anyway so uh that led to a argument and the argument ended in us breaking up so yeah it was emotional uh but um i'm fifty five and it's not my first break up so i just take it in stride and and move on uh well it's it's probably it's no one no no situation actually can be i feel uh at the time when you when you deal with a situation at any particular time there's probably always a better way to handle it after the fact but uh i would say back in the day back in the eighties when me and my  wife broke up i think i could've handled that one better because i was younger more hot tempered and more irrational so i could've handled that one better yes what the uh uh the way i broke the way i handled that situation well like i said uh being young and and inexperienced and and emotions and and attitudes and uh not being able to communicate with another person on the level of of understanding <laughter> hmm leaving home well it was like <sigh> what can i say it was about one o'clock two o'clock in the morning and i just decided to pack up and and and leave  uh without letting anyone know that i was leaving that was like one of the hardest decisions i've had to make sketchy loving but sketchy uh my family's in detroit and atlanta georgia i'm in california l_a i have no one out here so uh i'm basically on my own and i've been on my own for a long time so uh we communiate and we talk and send christmas cards thanksgiving cards you know and in that factor but uh as far as uh family it's it's it's sketchy no one hm uh i don't know uh most things that that i don't wanna remember i don't so and i have erased a lot of things from my memory or uh placed them in a closet which i can't open anymore to to remember that so but the most thing that i can say is uh uh i won't go into detail on it but a incident where it caused great bodily harm to a person in the last two weeks uh with the i've had uh this hearburn problem so in the last two weeks it's been really difficult for me to get uh some sleep 'cause i have a i have uh in my pocket right now i have a a jar of tums it's keeping me pretty uh sedated right now irritable um anxious um need to get things done uh and i feel like uh i have uh people and things that's against me and trying to block everything that i'm doing to succeed and that's been a great uh disturbance to me yes it is but you know like i said i take everything it with a grain of salt and i keep pushing because uh you can't stay mad or vengeful at any one person or any one thing too long because it doesn't accomplish anything so i have to keep pushing uh no basically i'm still <s> still the same i just just keep my thoughts <th> uh i keep my ideas that i need to do uh and try to accomplish uh uh what i need to uh uh accomplish post mm traumatic stress uh no uh uh yes uh back in uh oh nine two thousand nine um crying a lot uh not trusting uh suspiciousness of other people uh so what uh and i was uh recommended uh and referred to a medical uh uh um mental health uh facility for treatment off and on yes when i feel depressed and feel anxiety building up in me uh yes i still have treatment yes because i get a chance to express uh some of the things that i normally don't express and i can i can like blow off steam or uh blow off the anxiety part of uh my depression hmm well i don't know uh really really happy um oh when uh well i was really really happy when my uh the girl that i just broke up with came from upstate for us to be together that's when i was really really happy and then that turned around within two weeks but at that point in time when that happened i was really really happy witty um <laughter> witty um informative <inf> informative um um social uh i basically everybody say i need i should've became a counselor because i'm very enlightened in a lot of life's uh problems so uh my friends would describe me as helpful probably education more education not raising my sons well uh my son my my sons were young in age when me and my wife broke up out here and she moved and remarried and she has the she has the boys with her and they took on the new husband's name and i wasn't able to raise them like i would've wanted them raised patience more patience being more acceptable of other ideas and other people's opinions hmm there's nothing basically at home watching movies to myself i'm a loner my sons you're welcome see you later do i push the button now why aren't you married
438,female,0,2,<synch> yes i'm doing pretty good i was born and raised right here in los angeles <sigh> um the weather um would be number one i also like the diverse uh cultures i like the fact that there's a lot of different things here you can do and there's a lot of opportunity here um not just for myself but for my kids and um i think it's really a great place to be when you're trying to establish a career go to school um learn about different people the traffic the cost of living um sometimes i think it's too big and i think the transportation system as far as the bus and trains um is long overdue they need to revamp it or you know add more buses and things like that just make it easier for people to get around on public transportation i travel when i can a little bit here and there i have not been overseas yet which is a goal of mine within the next couple of years so i've just traveled domestically i try to take at least one trip a year somewhere i just like the fact of getting on the plane and going places um going particularly somewhere i've never been and learning about that place you know like so if i'm going to d_c i really look forward to it 'cause it's a historic city you know things like that um my most recent trip would've been d_c <laughter> last year um i went to go visit a friend and i stayed about three <thr> i think three to four days and i got to see the capitol um he showed me around showed me all the you know historic landmarks and sites the white house the capitol building um i got to see a lot of other different uh government buildings and um it was it was a a good experience the irony was i had to fly on nine eleven and so that had me a little uneasy but once i was in the plane up in the air i was okay and it was all good and once i was back home i was like yes but i i i miss the trip and i look forward to going back um attending uh my friend's wedding she had a destination wedding in hawaii um actually maui that was actually two three three years ago three years ago in august and um i've been trying to get back ever since and i wanna take my kids and i just love it there and i actually kinda look forward to to moving there one day um i have three sons um thirteen-year-old twins boys and my youngest is also a boy he's eight they um all have birthdays in june the twins are june ninth and my baby is june fourth and so they're just a few days apart but five years apart technically and they're just super super typical boys active all over the place hormones puberty um so it's actually an interesting time because you know the the two older boys are going through puberty um they're teenage years um my youngest um still trying to figure some things out for himself you know doing that transition stage of eight to nine years old so he'll be nine in june and then my oldest will be fourteen so it's a challenging time for me as well just the joy of watching what you put into being a parent every day and seeing how just with love and nurturing and um the right and you know well i can't say proper development but just with you know love and nurturing how a um baby grows into a toddler into you know a young boy to a teenager and then into a young man and so that experience alone has been rewarding just watching my sons grow up and go through these different stages and seeing how they have developed and you know seeing some of the things that they're going through now that so reminiscent of my teenage years and um it's just it's very rewarding and um actually i look forward to maybe even being a foster parent later down the line when they're older and off in college 'cause i really love children and giving back um mm there's probably a couple of things but i would just say um for me being a single parent is um the financial um well i would say that along with some of the emotional with <w> with them having um to bear the brunt of the responsibility of just child child rearing um you know the just the everyday things of what you have to deal with the uh sometimes when you're just tired you don't wanna be bothered or you're trying to do things for yourself you have to be reminded that oh okay i gotta cook or i have to go pick my son up or i have to take him to baseball practice uh this one want to go over here um this one is acting moody and you know just those those types of challenges um as well as the financial and you know making sure you know you're able to put food on the table you're paying your rent and you know you're keeping up with the day to day and that's those two are probably the hardest things um for me to deal with well i just um i take it day by day i just put one foot in front of the other and um i'm extremely spiritual so i just rely on god and pray a lot and meditate um if i see i need a little help if if you know i'm i'm i'm not above asking for help so sometimes if i have to reach out to people or you know see what other resources are out there to help me you know i try to do that and so for me right now my biggest challenge is just trying to go back to school to put myself in a better um economic situation so i can continue to provide for them comfortably um i studied communications actually i was a um journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology and now i'm studying business <laughter> i just thought that you know um there would be more opportunities for me with business um as far as jobs and then i you know have a desire to go to graduate school so i just figured in the long run it was a better um it would put me in a better position give me more opportunities um with the communications it's a little limited and especially as you get older um the fields of t_v reporting and things like that um are kinda become you know harder to obtain so i just thought eh i would go into something more realistic and um you know but uh i like both fields i really do i like communicating writing reading talking as you can tell and um so we'll see um <laughter> a couple probably but i would say ultimately would be traveling like working as like a travel writer um going to different destinations um trying different foods out um writing about different people cultures um learning and living you know uh about those different people and cultures living <l> living amongst <am> amongst the you know the the people there and um being interactive with the children and stuff like that so i kinda hope to be able to do that one day but yes um it it would be something along those lines and then the fallback would be a counselor social worker something in that area if i could encompass all three hopefully i can i i would like to do that um that's actually a hard question probably because i initially grew up very shy and um not so much shy as i am reserved now um but not conservative but just reserved and you know when i go somewhere i'm checking everything everybody else out and then once i become comfortable or acclimate to the situation then i'm like okay you know i warm up to the to the situation or the people but i'm also friendly i can be very friendly and outgoing i like to talk um you know i seem like a chatterbox but i'm not really so usually if i'm in a big space with a whole lot of people i don't like to be the center of attention <atten> attention i can attach myself to one or two people and you know become friendly with them but i i overall i am a open friendly person <laughter> um for me um it it could be something as simple as just unplugging everything all electronics and just sitting for a few moments meditating praying or reading a good spiritual scripture um if i'm able to i like to go for a good massage maybe get a facial um you know things that will i kinda like the physical part part of it i like massages things that really release tension um and if not then just like i said just sitting at home reading and praying or i like the beach i love the beach so sometimes i drive and go sit by the beach i like <li> also like to just maybe go and have lunch by myself or get a mani pedi or maybe go window shopping you know things like that mm pretty good sometimes i'm just like grr i don't really have so much a issue with the temper as i am i just i'm more impatient unfortunately a lot of times with people and you know situations so i just can become really irritated or irritable um quite agitated especially if it's that time of the month for me i just lose patience um outside of that i'm actually pretty good i try to be very you know conscious of where i'm at and be very patient with people especially if i could see that the person is like if if they're a new <n> a new checkout person at the the counter or cashier i do try to be i do try to be patient and understanding 'cause i would want that you know if it were me i would want someone to extend that to me um you know with my kids sometimes you know it's this it works both ways too once it's that time of the month i'm just like ugh just leave me alone um or i might have a short temper or a short fuse so i am conscious of it i try to be aware of it and and try to monitor it but you know like anybody i'm human and there are times or i have my days or moments when i could just like ugh go off and just lose it um <sigh> well i haven't really had it not per se an argument but there's been a ongoing thing with american express so i would say because it was not a personal contact but a company i eh we it it really was an argument but uh you know i i had some um issues with american express i had to call in about on i think saturday and i kept um i wasn't getting the response i expected and so i would get the whole contact the call was just back and forth very frustrating and i was upset and you know the rep was trying to overtalk me then i was trying to overtalk her so you <y> you know i don't know if you would consider that an argument but i would definitely say that's the last time when you know i just kinda like reached my boiling point to say the least and was really upset and eh that <th> that was the closest you know to an argument and then i had to call back this morning that one didn't really escalate to an argument but it was um a a a tense exchange for a minute or two probably the most recent contact and that would've been the one on saturday with american express um or actually it was on sunday yeah and um i know the person was trying to help me but you know when you you're constantly being told different things and i've had to call in about five or six times about the same situation and it not be resolved it just takes you there so um just i kept raising my voice said some things i shouldn't had um and just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact i like to really feel in control of the contact and so um it just took me there my blood pressure was raised <clears throat> excuse me and that was just a kind of a mess for a while for like maybe thirty minutes or an hour after that just irritable and agitated and upset and and so i always try to you know go back and pull from those and you know do my own sense of feedback and see how i could you know handle things differently but that's one i i definitely wish i could've kept my cool and been more level-headed and and not really raised my voice and you know um been more polite <sigh> mm well i've probably have had a couple but <clears throat> probably the most is a situation years ago when i just had my sons and they probably my twins they were probably about two and i was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and um it just was not a good time and he pretty much you know was not comfortable with me having another child at the time and um i wasn't comfortable with having another child either but wanted to keep the baby but he put me under so much stress and you know kind of i wanna say really pushed me into having terminating the the pregnancy and that's always stayed with me and i've always missed that pregnancy that child i think about that that baby or what could've been i try not to hold any um anger or resentment towards him or anybody about it but i know deep down inside secretly if i had it to do all over again i would've just i would've kept the baby and moved forward so that would've been probably the hardest especially emotionally i could deal with a lot and i have dealt with a lot you know um being unemployed or you know lot of financial problems but that to me was the hardest thank you no mm mm no um okay you know um i was laid off in december so i've been constantly trying to do things to you know get um back on my feet so that's been a little tough i've had i've had to face a lot of challenges and dealing with that and issues with child support and trying to find another job and going back to school so i my <m> my range of emotions have just have been just that a range and a very good friend of mine now who we both started off you know in the same place um about five years ago well she's been able to move forward and um go on with her life and now she's graduating in next month from u_s_c with her master's in social work so i'm feeling a little envious of that and i have been for like the past year but more so recently although i've very very happy for her you know and she's a good person and she deserves it but xxx of course deep down inside i wish it was me so that too has kinda been bothering me well i'm really good with um people i communicate well i like to talk i'm really good with children that's why i would like to teach or be a counselor um although i haven't not really tapped into it i know i'm a very creative person um i know i write pretty good um i could possibly be a creative writer but i know i'm very creative so if given the opportunity i know i could tap into that and really develop those skills something like with maybe songwriting um fiction writing um but probably like interior decorating anything artistic just anything 'cause i love music i love the arts i love drama i love plays um i'm not a big fashion buff but i do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that so um i think those would are are my strong points as well as just getting along with people i know i would make a great counselor people my friends come to me all the time i have a good ear for listening i'm a great mediator and i know how to because i've been through a lot and one of my friends called me the voice of reason the one that's actually graduating from s_c but um i know i'm like light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom and i don't know if it has to do with you know having older parents myself or how i grew up or i had i had very traditional southern parents um who instilled a lot of great values in me or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign i'm a pisces but um i'm i'm really good with people just you know period you know like i said i have my moments but i i know if it if it's something i could go into and develop i would do well mm not really some of the situations um i wish i would've waited to maybe have gotten married before i had children um picked a different partner um and i say that i mean my son's father is great but um a great father for my kids but not so much as a partner for me we're not together we haven't been together in years but i'm just saying overall i think um had i yeah i think i would say if i could let me backtrack that say not finishing school when i should have and not following my my dreams and goals and doing things as i kinda was planning initially and i think that's that would i honestly be the one thing i could say i regret is not following my goals and and finishing school on time and and pursuing what i really wanted to do stay focused and finish school and pick a career path and stay on that and stay motivated and don't let anything or anybody deter you mm um i think i'm pretty stable and consistent just with overall i think um how i face adversity how i face <f> i face things you know um i am a pretty committed person i try to you know if i say imma do something i try to stick to it i'm a very loyal friend um and um i'm proud of the fact that i've i've maintained and done a pretty good job with raising my kids solo okay great thank you bye bye
337,female,1,10,yeah i'm doing okay how are you doing i'm originally from like a suburb <su> a suburb of l_a from the san gabriel valley i like the diversity i like the vibe of the city i've lived other places and it's just not as happy here i feel like i can really thrive here so i just like l_a like all the things that are so close together then there's a lot of interesting things that totally different parts of the city just miles away from each other uh don't like the traffic don't like all the cars but i can live with it i mean there's not that much i don't like i studied music um vocal performance i studied music technology things like that yes right now um i sing in an opera company but my i do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the l_a opera so i do have a day job i work at a call center that caters mostly to performers and actors and things like that and it's really good because if i get a call i can call in and change my shift very easily so it's actually a pretty good gig and i do some uh technology gigs sometimes you know it's do some recording some live sound stuff but i'm kinda wanna get away from that do some video work sometimes but again i wanna get away from that i wanna go back to the  because i find that performing more is more interesting i like being talent more than i like being crew <laughter> so i kinda wanna get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what i wanna do with my life sometimes i mean per my personal life yeah so i do have a shell that i put out there to deal with people but if i'm at home you know i'd kinda rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever talk to family   don't really have too many close friends <clears throat> but yeah you know i'd rather keep to myself uh moderately close to the family that i have left i've actually lost a lot of family in the last ten years or so but like thank you <laughter> but like uh my i'm close to my husband and you know i've got couple of cousins i talk to and my aunt that i have an aunt that i talk to a bit but it's not like we're interacting every day close together  but it's somewhat close mostly i sing or i read or i write or just hang out and try to clear my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesn't work but i try to do that and try to just clear everything and see what starts coming back in and sometimes <ss> sometimes that works sometimes it doesn't but mostly creating things um contacting my family some <so> you know through facebook or whatever works but mostly in my free time i create things i'd like to travel more i like to travel by car a lot um i mean my idea of like having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip and i like to travel more um i would love to travel for work things or whatever but i don't get as much of an opportunity as i would like to to travel seeing <see> uh particularly traveling by car seeing like the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know feeling the vibrations of the area change  i like just seeing what's out there seeing and i know that there's a bigger world outside of  where i am and where i live and my world and i like to see that but i like to leave that too and go back to my own world <laughter> <laughter> <clears throat> um let's see xxx a trip that i like to take is to make the drive from here to nevada whether i go all the way to vegas or just go to state line um my cousin and i would take what we call exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway so we'd take those we'd just   sort of impromptu with like <li> a day or two notice just move things around just take off so those are actually trips that i i like making <mak> 'cause i take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight just small short trips that aren't very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how um you know the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas  so close to home but not but not close to home close to home but uh still a world away so that 'cause i don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever but that's just little things that kinda put things back in perspective and and clear my head and things like that i mean 'cause there's sort of a sense of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway so i i like i like doing that the last time that happened was may of last year that's the last time i was able to do that we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who's ten years younger than i am and we kinda grew up like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland empire which is where they live so they kinda took me on a last hurrah and we drove up to vegas and looked around and came back 'cause i actually lived in vegas for awhile but i didn't like it so they kinda i showed <show> showed them some of the locals sites around there and we came back and was you know an overnight trip but we were driving the entire time <laughter> so it was kind of an interesting uh things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals people who can't fight back and they're mean to them just because they can't fight back   and i actually like to see people who are strong <st> as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate or what have you so i think that's one thing that's makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason you know not people <pe> for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it just that kinda really just makes me mad when i'm annoyed i'll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me then i'll wind up lashing out somehow either   you know verbally just cutting 'em with a quip or you know i mean i i rarely just i rarely will yell at somebody but i'll try to you know if i'll try to walk away and defuse it if that doesn't work then i'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me <laughter> that usually works  not in like legal trouble or anything because usually i'll find a way to get them to leave me alone um so there's not really like big trouble but 'cause i think 'cause it's it it is off-putting and it's not expected <exp> the expected reaction and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction 'cause i know that will work and get people away from me so it's not really in trouble and if  it's is trouble it's usually trouble that it's from their the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because it's usually a situation i can get out of  so as long as they leave me alone you know i don't i i'll walk away from it uh the last time i argued with somebody like person <per> like a person <per> like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my uh the last thing i can think of was i argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law 'cause she's got dementia and so we one of the reasons we came out here from the inland empire was to take care of her 'cause she won't go anywhere but l_a i mean she is like hardcore angelino like you know we we know we are the we're that in our nature but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere <laughter> but um so we came out here to take care of her  and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is 'cause she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process  but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what she wants 'cause he's a mama's boy like i am i'm a mama's girl even though i've lost my mom like four years ago i'm still a mama's girl and i'll still <st> and i still and i know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much and that's what they want so you wanna get it for 'em and because you know they you know that happened when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it  and you wanna do that for them now like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about somebody you feel deserves it but it's kinda dangerous for her you know and i don't want things <thi> something to happen to her yet i want her to remain who she is for as long as she can 'cause i know it the disease that she has is gonna erase who she is eventually and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her twenty four hour medically trained care but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves 'cause it's not that bad but it's getting where she really shouldn't <shou> has no business living by herself anymore so the solution right now is he stays there most the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do i handle the outside things i run the errands i take her to the store things like that he does the day to day things makes sure she has <ha> she eats makes sure she you know has clean clothes things like that so i mean it's a partnership it's a it's a dual effort it's very much a dual effort but i would like her to move in with us so that was that's like a source of it's not really like yelling screaming argument but lively discussion <laughter> you know than debate meh it's not insurmountable i mean life's not gonna be easy ever and if it is that's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you so as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life it's not gonna be easy but you deal with it and you you move on uh the most positive influence i think have been probably my mother and my grandmother 'cause my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually gave me a lot of confidence and but were realistic about it so i mean i think i have sort of a realistic sort of a downer temperment <laughter> to myself but they but they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something i can't get over and that you know life's gonna go on you know my mom would say to me when you're forty you're forty whether you're working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life and i think that was a big influence on how i lived have how i've lived my life since she's passed   i regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because i think it may have clouded some of my decisions now i do have underlying conditions and everybody in my family is diabetic and i didn't take care of that when she was the last year of her life 'cause i was too busy wanting to get her home my focus was to get her home so i didn't eat right i didn't take my insulin right um i wound up making myself insulin resistant that that year just 'cause my blood sugar was so high for eh like a year eating just horrible foods when i did eat so it really took a toll and i really actually made myself very sick  and i'm wondering well if i didn't if i would've taken care of myself and i had my head on completely straight and my my vision <vi> my vision and my thoughts weren't completely <complete> weren't clouded would i have made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed 'em and when she needed me to be to step in and make the decisions for her because she  uh wound up having a health catastrophe 'cause she had kidney well she had kidney damage that wound up being kidney failure and her health insurance provider missed that so she wound up having sort of this whole catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down she wound up having a stroke at like fifty one she had had a small stroke and it just kinda went down from there so i'm thinking well if i didn't if i had taken care of better care of myself would i have been able to take better care of her and i know there wasn't anything i would've been able to do to prevent her death but what if i if i would i have been be able to make it easier on her if i would have taken care of myself and that's like one huge regret that i have oh i know i am <laughter> but xxx it's my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that i care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and i know other people i can't really direct them into my own vision because they're their own individual beings and they can't you know be what i want them to be and i know they're not going to be but i still have you know my ideals and i want the way i want everything to go and i want everybody that i care about to be happy and to be able too  fit into my life in a way in the best way possible but i know 'cause they're other beings and i know i'm not gonna be able to do that for them and they're not gonna be able to do that for me but it's still my ideals <laughter> so i have to sometimes have to look at it and go well is this what i want because i want it or what is what they want and what's their <thei> is it their decision or mine and it's usually it's theirs and i know it's theirs so i so if you really care about somebody you're just gonna support them and go with them but  it's still kinda hard <laughter> for for me and know i gotta get over it um ten or twenty years ago probably to have been more assertive in starting my own life because i wound taking care of my mother i mean she got sick literally the weekend i graduated from college <laughter> and i had a job lined up and i had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her and i think i would've been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside  the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about ten years so i think i i probably would've done that um but i tell myself just do that you keep who you are and learn to separate your you who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family to keep a sense of of yourself that's probably what i would've and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself that's probably the advance advice of what i would give myself    ten years ago <laughter> no no no but probably 'cause i haven't gone to a doctor about it <laughter> 'cause i don't wanna know and i mean it's not i know there've been times in my life where i've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it but i'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment and of it gets <ge> um after my mother had died i mean it'd been this long battle for a year that we lost and i didn't know if i if i was to blame for that it's like logically i knew i wasn't but how could i convince myself of that um two weeks after she died i wound up with pulmonary embolisms in one in each lung because i didn't take care of myself for a year and i figured oh i'm thirty years old if you know whatever i do to myself i can get over no <laughter> turns out no <laughter> but um i mean i wound up having to take more medication because of that uh it's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to get out of that depression 'cause so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden i didn't it's like the rug was pulled out my like bottom fell out of my world after that so that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression um i almost got divorced because of it because i just didn't want anything anymore  so and i was i being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point and i started getting very distant from him just pushing everything away just you know figuring well what am i gonna do with the rest of my life now and it it's been a fight you know you mean there times when no i couldn't get up just stay in bed and sleep all day you know but then realizing that when my mother died i had four cats to look after two are mine two are hers and so i wound up adopting the two that were hers i mean well they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you know own own supplies i took that responsibility of doing it for them so that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not i was gonna get up and provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go without taking care of myself but they couldn't they didn't you know so they eh they actually got me up and and made me go out and face things even though i didn't want to didn't just didn't just kinda wanted to curl up and die but that would've been my choice not theirs and they i mean what would happen to them if i wasn't there to take care of them they would've been you know sent to a shelter or whatever probably  and maybe they would've not been readopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for  for me i mean for me making selfish decisions   so it's like i need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed <laughter> so <s> and that's actually been a motivating factor is to to 'cause i've figured out that if it was just me i'd be able to live without a lot of stuff i mean i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it wouldn't be a big deal i wouldn't care   as long as i was doing what i wanted with my life but i have a family to look after now  so i have to go out and do things  you know i i have to go out and look for legitimate work you know day you know day job i have to you know   but i'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what i wanna do with my life but yet i have to take care of my family so i'm   been working on on a balance of the two very <laughter> but it's worth it i mean  it would be very i'd have a lot less things to worry about if i just lived in my car and said forget it <laughter>  but keeping a residence down paying bills things like that  it's it's difficult but you have to do it you know if you want you want anything <anyth> if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that  and i and and i know that  but  it it gets hard sometimes you do wanna give up  but then  it's like well what's the alternative  i mean i don't think i could live a comfortable life  'cause if i did i wouldn't do anything <laughter> i have to be slightly uncomfortable or i'm not gonna do anything with myself i'm just gonna  be content to just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with my cats or whatever  and i wouldn't get anything done  uh very  anxious and nervous and i mean what if  i don't find  enough you know enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if um  you know what what if i can't   keep a semblance of stability in my life and it it's actually hard work to be stable <laughter> and i know it's hard work to be stable but  what you know it's just eh a lot of what ifs  and and i don't think it's things that haven't happened and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened and i know that  but it still happens <ha> it still creeps in  so that's actually  a source of  anxiety  but then you try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it  but i i i know it it's a cycle and i'll go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do to saying okay what is the fundamental thing i need to take of here  i mean what <wha> what is just extraneous and what can <c> what can what is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue  and so  figure out how to figure things out that way and then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit but then something'll pop up and the what ifs will come up again  mm i'll have to  uh  figure it out again <laughter> but i know it's a cycle i know um what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it   you get over it pretty quickly you get through it  the last time i felt really happy i don't know zz um i  huh <laughter> that's a good question that actually <ac> that actually surprisingly stumped me  because i do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much sometimes just kinda eh in the middle um really like overjoyously happy i don't know  i i'm not i can't think of <o> of when that happened i don't know you don't know  perceptions of other people i mean  probably as somebody who  oddly enough somebody who is laid back and you know  handles things as they come but i don't see myself as that   at all and it's a it probably that i can think on my feet and i'm not afraid to  hussle my butt off and do whatever i have to to survive and get things done  um that  and i can do it creatively and i try to  strive for balance  probably  probably the best things about me <laughter>  that i'm doing basically what i want with my life which even though it's not all easy it's not  um you know i'm not financially well off or anything it's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives 'cause i have an aunt that i really don't talk to  who and the reason why i don't talk to her is because she's always miserable i mean she's got a career that she  it's more of a job that she fell into  'cause my older aunt uh loves animals but didn't wanna be a veterinarian so she became a dog groomer  and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time   but her hands <ha> you know she started getting arthritis in her hands and she had um the actually my cousin's father went and kinda stole all the money from her business so she lost her business   and she kinda she retired early 'cause between that and the arthritis she wound up retiring early  she employed my younger aunt who was still a dog groomer but she hates it   and it's like change your life if you hate your life so much change it  and the thing <thi> the thing i'm most proud of is  yeah i'm not as financially well off as she is but i'm doing what i want with my life you know i can  be creative i can have creative people around me people who i actually like to talk to around me  people i actually like in my life and  be happy with that  and i see a lot of people who aren't  and it it gives me a sense of of maybe a a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say i'm not like that  and i'm actually doing what i want even though there's sacrifices i'm still fundamentally doing what i want with my life now thank you <laughter> okay  thank you <laughter> goodbye

population quite a bit you know  and I have a lot of friends here so I guess you know I don't want to be anywhere else  like I said the traffic you know I was on the phone with 500 that's always kind of in a crummy the cost of living that's really you know terrible but it's always expensive and you know I really don't like  I really don't like you know I can just seems like I'm always one of those places were like you know you have like a ton of money and fame and fortune or like you know you're down and you know that the ghettos you know  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I have I've been to a couple places you know book very brief in a Multiverse for school I want Arizona and New York in Montana anthropology like you know and archaeology field trips and things like that that's what I'm doing right now  I like getting away from the city you know I was in Yosemite last year in Ohio in the summer for vacation that was kind of nice you know your family was really really need to see but you're busy getting away from the city I guess you're not getting away from the job getting away from the stress here  I actually studied political science and I also studied economics I'm a big kind of political you know junkie you know that begin with for a natural Valentine with that kind of field of study  I was I was but I lost my job and you know that's kind of a bummer you know the last it's cheese it's only been maybe a year and a half an hour maybe two years and you know the condom got bad and the budget cuts got bad and you know I wish I was working there again  I love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me  well I wanted to be a lawyer one time I want to be a lawyer in a and that's why I took political science and I took a double major in economics and the sad thing is the sad thing is that a you know what to get into law school to take the entrance exam called the Alsace and I study for a leg really hard core you know it for about a year and I took the test and like an idiot I didn't feel right about that that day it was kind of an off-day and you know it's like going to the big game of the Super Bowl by just don't I don't feel like I did well and I cancel the test and so on  do I kind of regret that you know  tell me about it  I'm not really shy at all I'm definitely not shy but outgoing and me not one of these people not flamboyant you know I'll talk to people I don't mind talking to people I don't mind meeting people that's fine with me but it's not like I'm you know Dinan to kind of meet anybody  sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but  I guess  these days you know I play guitar and I taught myself how to play guitar thank you thank you I should actually be doing more of it but I also like to exercise I'm going to die right now but my dad's been terrible time eating habits have been terrible but the exercise part is just great I love to X I love to run that's one of my best things to do for stress is the ground and they pop workout I just wish that my eating habits where we're in line we're a little bit better you know  okay  my temper could be you know definitely improved a lot you know I'm in a lot of times I I feel I'm one of these introvert types person when it comes to let you know I don't mind being an extrovert or like meeting people and like having a good time whatever we know what I'm mad I really don't want to be you no talking to people I don't like to yell I don't have to scream but I'd like to hear I don't like to fight a kind of close down a lot I don't know what you want to be left alone sometimes I tend to drag it on for longer than it should be in the wife doesn't like it too much and maybe you know I just don't I just want to talk him I just don't want to deal with it it kind of close down and shut you know  shut off for a little bit  cheese doesn't happen too often  maybe with my wife you know it'll probably be something silly who knows  who knows  the thing is I don't have a lot of guilt I don't do anything like to make me ever feel like you know that bad of a person you know I'm there are things that like you know call my nersons you know I get white lies or whatever you know what like nothing like so atrocious that makes me feel like guilty  can you give me an example of a  let's see I guess sometimes you know you know I'm very guy but you know sometimes the times you know I like to smile a girl or like you know get a girl's attention you know I don't know I never do anything about it never get the phone number you know but sometimes I like to like talk to people I guess you know  and that you wish you would handle different  well that's a good question I guess  I guess you know I always have to look the same but does not I don't ever wish to deliver to ever change it and never wanted to handle things differently I always kind of I'm pretty comfortable the way I handle things and you know I think that I could be a lot worse than like you no shouting and screaming and hitting in this and that and that's just not me you know I think the best thing to do you know it's kind of like get a lot of breathing room a lot of space and I don't wish for that to change or to handle any that differently I just don't really know what else to do you know and you know the last thing I want to do is start talking about you no feelings or any of this you know that's the last thing I want to do and so like I don't wish that I handle things like that differently in that way  tell me about your relationship with your family  well you know I'm pretty happy with my family right now you know if I'm married and we have a baby along the way which is kind of nice if some cats thank you thank you if cats and a dog a weenie dog and my mom I love my mom dearly she has diabetes which you know she doesn't control you know she doesn't control it and like it like FX4 health and nose has me worried about her and I stressing out about her and she could do so much too late for vented and she doesn't sand  you know I have a good relationship with my mom I love her dearly and actually have a good relationship with everybody I think I think I have a ton of family and friends get along with me pretty well actually you know  there are times I mean it's pretty easy for me to go to sleep actually I feel like you know I sleep like a baby the only problem I have I think is I feel like you know sometimes like you fall asleep and you have you just going to sleep and you can kind of like you know like you almost kind of looked for it is like I was falling sensation or something like that and it didn't happen that often but it happens and before the most time apart when I sleep like a really good  well right now generally I've been feeling worried and anxious and you know intense the reason why is because I see my mom right rallies today but found out my mom something she didn't tell me the whole story and I'm kind of waiting to this is over so we can I can find out what's wrong with her but you know I'm worried about her she's she's at the doctor's right now so that doesn't tell me anything good and you know I'm trying to find a job so that has me worried too and you know the baby along the way so that has me worried so I feel like you know overwhelmed with a just a lot of like you know things to do in like and  and I'm a lot on my plate in like a lot of it doesn't have anything to do with me but I have to handle it like you know so like I guess  well I keep myself distracted I keep myself busy I feel like a busybody you know the more you know it seems like it's not a good thing because I feel like I'm just adding more things on my plate so you know like one of things I do is like exercising so I have to workout everyday you know what that takes an hour that takes an hour to like you know chicken change you need to start raining in Lagos to the whole thing of stretching and cooling down at 6 to take some time and then they can shower and all that kind of stuff to it takes time so it but I have to do a daily do I cope with it and that way I also cope with it to you know playing guitar but that's just more of a distraction you know what I mean keeping keeping busy that way it's just seems like it's not you know I'm working towards you know the goals you know that I need to do let you know if I find another job which I should be doing but then  in all it's one of those things were like I find that there's no good jobs I've been looking and looking like something that I do it it's just not what I want to do it just doesn't seem like I want to do is Lay terrible jobs  you know it's it's  probably harder than I'm thinking about it because sometimes I feel like you know one of these things is like  I feel like it is hard but it's not I mean they're always I can cope with it you know I just got out of a kind of accepted it a lot you know I can't internalize it and like you know it's not something that's like I'm out on the street or anything like that but you know it is a worry  I've never been diagnosed with PTSD I used to work with  no  tell me about the last time you felt  man  10 years ago the last time was really happy maybe  me nothing I feel like nothing makes me happy no more you know I learned a new song on the guitar I feel like not even happy about that you know I feel like I'm you know I work out something that kind of makes me happy no running like you know fast and working out but that doesn't make me so excited or anything like that it just makes me feel good you know so I have these these These Times where I'm just you know feeling good about myself in a feeling you know but I'm never feeling great I'm never feeling happy and they were feeling like so sensationalize like you know and and and you know incredible that you know it's just another mile times where there's a few good times you know in a few bad times with a good times and never extremes you know never really good times and never really see no choices baddest X you know  well I wish this is Diet would work out a little bit better you know but that's kind of hard you know cuz I'm the kind of guy who just likes who just likes you know you know why you like Mexican food makes you know I'm a snack and I don't know I just feel like that could I could change I wish I could change my eating habits that way I can let you know cuz I work out so much I feel like I do so much money and so much activity that like you know that if I got my tight and check you know that was also can change you know  my my I guess my my desire to like you know get a head like right now I feel just so like the kind of me so bad and like things are so unwell that you know it's like pointless to even like you know look for these kind of jobs like it just seems like I just wish I had a little more inspiration and motivation to like to  do things  the one thing I regret is is not is not you know it's this LSAT thing you know you know  not passing the test again with cuz I'm sure I could have got into it at school but then again later you know it has me thinking like do I really want to pay once you let you know Law School tuition and the cost of that and then you know just to just to be power down with more work and things like that I don't know it just didn't seem like like  there is this idea of justice and and and republicanism and you know things that I really ain't here to that I fall in love with a that I don't want to get away from but it's just seems like it's a ton of work and money and just too late for the smallest percentage of success it that you know you might not be able to do in that kind of feel you might and you know it just didn't seem like like it's worth overcoming the obstacles I need to overcome  advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  I have no idea I would have 20 years ago I would tell myself maybe  and I think I've done everything really well for myself except for the outside thing you know which I regret on one hand on the other hand you know I'm not sure if I regret cuz what the bills and all that kind of stuff I told you about and I think you know I've waited to get married and waited to have a kid you know pretty cautious about this is why I don't take drugs I don't drink I don't fight I don't do any of these things that let you know that I think that real people have him in and they really like you to ruin their life you know it's like I'm pretty happy and content with being in or the cautious you know I don't know  okay  how do your best friend describe you all my best friend I think he kind of his likes me he wishes that I would do more things with him but he works at night and you know it's one of the things I think most people not just my best friend but my wife and remind me the rest of my family so that I don't put a lot of time and attention to them and they think that I'm pretty great when you give them the time of day and my attention but I don't know if I'm really there all the time you know I don't know if I'm really you know I'm always thinking about something else I don't know if I really can give him a real you know shoulder to cry on or you know if they ask for something you don't usually do it you know but I almost feel like it's like a chore like you know Legacy you know if they really need me then I'll do it you know if it's just asking for a favor I almost felt you know I do have a lot of lackluster that I have hardness I just  it's not because I hate him I feel like I'm their friend makes them somehow you know like it makes me think you know the times I think I don't want them down the aisle my friends but it's the same time I just feel like it's it's more it's not it's not it's more like a chore to do instead of a  willingness like it oh my God like I just want to help you is that it's never like that it's just something that I do because I kind of have to do you know you got to go to do things for your friends you know in the end because of your friends you know and I do like them and they probably would do it for me and I know so I just do the things you know just  what are you most proud of in your life  well there are a couple of things that I do like that I could feel good about myself you and I ran the LA Marathon that kind of felt good you know I've graduated from college that kind of feels good do you know what I mean but the thing is I don't feel like like that proud of myself for you know those things alone like graduated from college you know has it really made me successful you don't need me running the marathon hasn't made me sit there like half merits you know we're like the great in or may not have done it except Friday but you know they're going to make stepping stones It Like That I Used to Know life-long  benefit from doing other than the fact that I can say that I've done  yeah yeah no problem no problem thank you for your time you know I hope you enjoy your being in this computer  a goodbye I'm going to sleep right now  I think we're good here  yeah
331,male,0,8,okay  all right  how about what she's at okay. Thank you  yes  okay  Connecticut  to be an actor  well I moved to San Francisco in 94 and then I moved to Atlanta in 96 and then I moved out here to be an actor and I became a realtor instead  I'm to be on a TV show actor  it's pretty hard to get discovered and  you have to be lucky and you have to know the right people and you have to be talented  that really no I don't travel that much I used to move every couple of years to a different city and then I've been here for a while so I don't travel  the weather there's always something to do and  that's pretty much it  the people here tend to be a little more rude and it's just always a fast pace  but when I moved here I was 25 so it was a lot more fun because when you're young in the city you can have a lot of fun and then I got into the real estate and did really well for a while and then the market crashed and so now I'm old and I'm not making any money so times are tough  no no I'm not much of a more of an extrovert  when I don't get what I want and rude people and  just inconsiderate people  I'm pretty good at controlling my temper when I'm not like if I if I drink alcohol it'll make my temper go worse but when I don't drink I'm pretty good at controlling my temper  the last time I argued with somebody was  somebody that owes me money  I live in West Hollywood  no no no I live alone I have a dog  it's good I mean I don't like my neighbors I hate my neighbors but the ones upstairs just moved out so that's good news hopefully the ones that move in or not that noisy and the ones below I just can't stand because they argue with  why because they cuz my hardwood floors they say that I've been there for 10 years and they still argue about the noise of me walking on my hardwood floors  yeah  what was the question  my mother has been a very positive influence she's always kept me on track she lived with me for the last 10 years until she recently moved to Rhode Island to live with my brother  very close to my mother not so close with my brother were close but we're not like close close so I mean we love each other we just don't really understand each other all the time  outgoing life of the party  ambitious  and sometimes Cut Throat  hum  do you always able to get through the things I need to get through to get to where I want to be  I'm generous I'm loyal I'm friendly I'm accommodating and  that's about it  no  yes  about 4 years ago  well I had was beating up and I had identity theft and you know I was just afraid to go out so I needed to get over that so after spending one year in in my home without leaving that just depressed all the time I I said I have to get out and start talking to people and so I did  thank you  I'm okay I'm panicking about the job situation you know cuz my bills are pretty high and I don't really have a steady income right now  so that's what's worrying me the most is my financial situation  yeah I mean  well basically it's like I just recently quit drinking altogether so I don't drink anymore so I'm noticing yeah I mean it's good cuz the number one I don't have the money and number two I don't like the way I act when I drink I'm so so that's a positive thing but will the when I was drinking and help me just forget and numb myself now I have to feel through the feelings which is pretty good cuz I can talk my way through them so I guess I'm evolving  oh yeah long time ago you know I've taken many medications here and there and they really some of them would numb me some of them would make me feel hyper so I've recently decided in the last 6 months 3 to 6 months just to not take anything so I don't take anything I barely even take an aspirin  to get my body to a to get my body to a normal state  not really  always worrying just a lot of worrying always worrying worrying worrying about everything oh what happens if I get in a car accident what happens if I can't pay my mortgage what happens if I eat just so many things I worry about and that's what was making me depressed  I do at some point I've had some good therapist and I've had some bad therapist I tend to like the ones that talk back to me and kind of give me some guidance as opposed to the ones that just listen and then they just say okay your time is up so and just prescribed me medication so I think I'd be better with a psychiatrist psychologist as opposed to a psychiatrist  well I'm not going to therapy now but  the therapy that I had before I was more like people trying to just come in and check in and give me medication I have had other therapy where I was back in the forest like okay well this is what I think about this and you think about this and that kind of therapy is better  I just I wasn't getting the right therapist recently so and I knew that the root of my problem was the drinking cuz it's a depressant so  stopping the drinking is definitely made me have a much clearer mind and just a work through things myself you know  I can't really think of anything right now  it's been a long time I can't really think about a time when I felt really happy  okay when I was a kid I had a little dog and this big dog came in and attacked and killed it so then a little while later my father  came and he says to my brother and me we were kids go to the car there's two packages in the car so go get them so I was like yeah yeah yeah cuz I never listen to my parents like a spoiled brat to go to the car what's up  he said go to the car and get this out of the car so I finally went when I open the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food so that's one of my memorable experience  yeah cuz I'm an animal lover so  just the way that I've treated people before when I was hurting I was really mean or rude to people but I felt like you know I was hurting I had to hurt everybody around me so ever since I stopped drinking I don't do that anymore so I'm  so I think the problem is is the drinking and so now that I've let that go cuz I was doing it for the wrong reasons you know I was doing it to them not feel I wasn't doing it to be sociable  getting a career that is really stable like you know like a doctor or a nurse or an attorney something that you know or in advertising I should have gone into that a sales position is it could be very well and very good or very bad so you always have to be on it and sales you can make a ton of money in sales but when you make your money save your money don't go spend it on extravagant things  what I have a job when I when I'm able to work when I'm helping other people  what other people around me are happy and laughing when I can make people laugh that that puts me in a good mood  okay thank you  you're welcome thank you  okay is this modeled after a real person or is it just like they just
403,female,0,0,"thank you  at the door  hi I'm Ellie  are you okay with this yes  how are you doing today I'm doing really good  I'm from Granada Hills California it's the San Fernando Valley part of Los Angeles  I love the weather I like the diversity in people I like how you can go to a neighborhood and it's not just one racer kind of food I love the beaches all the activities you could go do the theme parks aquarium stuff like that museums  this smog  there's a lot of creepy guys  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I've pretty much child around La I've been cross-country and back three times twice with when I was 17  what do you enjoy about  I like meeting new people and trying different foods and seeing how other people live  I want to hear  when I was seventeen I ran away with my boyfriend to Upstate New York to Watertown it was a like a Navy Army kind of town we had an apartment there are it snowed a lot we sold antique Spirit living  awesome  getting calluses pressed houses for the Sunset Strip Music Festival through friend and getting to meet rock stars and hang out I like the private parties  I'm very outgoing I love people  sometimes when I'm feeling  what is the fastest guy  what do you do  am I go to the gym and work out quite a bit I find it helps relieve stress and keeps my energy level going I really notice if I don't work out a couple of days I feel a little more tired than normal and is it helps me feel good  I'm pretty good at it I'm very, I worked a lot of events and jobs where you're dealing with like thousands of people a day and people you need to talk to you and you have to remain calm and you know they're the customer so you have to make them feel wanted and good and realize that you're getting paid cuz the money they're spending so I'm good at resume resolving like consumer complex and stuff on the job  I had a drunk friend that was just falling around and yelling and saying rude things to people and I kind of started getting loud like just telling her to stop doing that I didn't know that she was embarrassing and what she was saying to people was very mean and you know and I wonder like if you're talking to people like that they might not like it and they could attack you or something you know you never know it is LA  what's something you feel guilty about  I really don't feel guilty about anyting decisions I've made in my life I think I've made really good decisions and I always stick with my moral compass what I'm doing I grew up in church so I haven't gone in years but I still have those values and you know the rules the Ten Commandments and stuff in my head  I had a slumlord landlord and I wish that I called you know the proper authorities and follow through on a court case instead of letting him like kind of bully me out because it wasn't up to code  a few years back I was dating a guy and he wanted me to move back to where he was from and after a few months you know he was coming early and going back home I decided to move there and I had just started you know this business is doing event planning was picking up and I decided to leave there and try to do it there and you know on the east coast and it didn't work out but it was tough deciding like should I leave LA and make this jump and try something new and experienced something new or stay and what I was doing  I was I had a degree in Dental Assisting I did that for like a year I didn't like it and then I was sending Communications like radio and television broadcasting and journalism  I'm somewhere I'm doing a van work and I wrote for a magazine a couple years and I'm trying to like get a website going and then have like where I'm controlling my own riding and what's going on instead of writing for someone else  I always wanted to ride and was always into the news and music and art growing up I really like Connie Chung she was like a Channel 4 newscaster in the eighties and I love Barbara Walters  I was a nerd  relationship with your  tell my sister she doesn't talk to any of the family and I have a good relationship with my mom I never really knew my dad it doesn't bother me  I have cousins and stuff but everyone's scattered across the country so I don't really talk to them and phone we just communicate on Facebook or like Twitter  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep so I go right to sleep when I get tired I just go to sleep  how you been doing lately three good energetic I've been motivated to go look for more van work you know event planning stuff and really grinding in more than I was  I mean it's kind of hard cuz you got to talk to people and get them to trust you and see that you could plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event than someone else  I mean I'm generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens like someone gets cancer the one I know dies  I want to say that I'm just super like oh my God happy all the time but it's like an even Keel that I feel pretty good all the time  I'm very talkative and friendly and I could approach strangers and talk to them Eddie's and I could adapt to different situations and even if it's not my scene or situation or group of people that I'm used to I could still jump in talk to people and be comfortable and make friends and adopt  what are some things you wish you could change about you  I want to make more money  I'm over in like second grade the people used to make fun of me cuz I was very tall and skinny and I had like straight A's were in the highest grades and Lacrosse so people would make fun of me and call me giraffe  stuff like that  very talkative she would just say that I talked to everyone  and I'm very friendly and if you need help that I'll help someone you know  a recently I went up to Oceanside and visited a friend I've known years and we just went out for burgers and hang out on the beach and we got her two-year-old son and like chicken in the park and played and it was really nice and they was cool visiting or I didn't seen her in six months and it was really fun and I want to go again and  I like the area  I guess maybe I could be trying to find my own work more like for my business instead of working for other people  I think I pursue it but I think maybe I could put a little more time and day into it  tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase her memory  I don't really know anything like  that we want a raise or not happen  okay  is there anything you regret  no I feel good about my choices I made and I think I'm on the right path and a lot of things I wanted to do than balls rolling and I'm you know getting things done I'm not as big as I want to be but I feel like I'm on my way there  advice would you give yourself 10 or 20  I'm like 10 years ago I would have told myself to work more in the daytime instead of going out as much as I was  my friend we call Mojo  Mojo has a magazine and I just wrote years and he really pushes me to like keep riding and keep doing the Vance and keep on the ball I'm rolling and he's one of the biggest people you know my life tummy you're talented you could do it you know he's just a really good like motivation for me  you know being published I've been on TV shows and just getting my own event thing going and  I have a lot of people who read what I ride everyday and follow-on I just think it's a you know it's not exactly honey where I want to be but it's great start  and I work to get to that point  great thanks  computer-related survey about"
376,female,1,12,hashemite hair you see what you look like oh my God  all right now  so this picture is not based on a real woman at all  okay so when she said I'll just wait for the buttons not working and I'll come back to you okay  hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today  creative  yes  I'm doing okay it's still morning so  I'm from the East Coast Massachusetts  yes  I moved to LA when I was a child with my parents pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter  I haven't been back to the last time I was back there was that three years ago for Christmas  LA's very hustle-bustle there's a lot of people that are angry and a lot of people don't care about the other person here in LA and which Becky is the East Coast that the thought pattern is a lot different you know your neighbors are friendly to your neighbors and Tammy way that you see in the street  so yeah  well since I was a kid I was fairly young at first it was rough I was getting in trouble a little bit in school but after all that surpassed I did fine in high school and stopping even took some college courses  well I love the beach and I love the mountains I like to go hiking and I like walking along the beach I just live a few blocks away from the beach so it's easy  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes  do you travel  no not at all  it's not interested I've been to Mexico a couple of times when I was younger went to Ensenada but other than that I'm not interested in leaving United States especially with what's been going on lately overseas  okay  actually child psychology and I was in the nursing program for a little bit but I had some problems at home which caused me to drop out  that's right  I don't have one to be honest I admire people that are doing the job that they love I mean like football players they love playing football and they get paid all that money I'll grade is that so  I'm pretty outgoing when I meet somebody at first I might be a little bit reserved because we all when we meet somebody pass judgment as to if we want to continue communicating with the person or not but once I decided I like that person or whatever I I talked a lot so  hey  yes  I like watching movies I like I used to like reading but lately my concentration level hasn't been so great so it's hard to get into a good book  not good at times I have a  some Outburst every once in awhile to say depends on how angry I get  I yesterday and it was with my partner and actually be honest I don't remember what it was about It's just sometimes people can have an ugly attitude and I don't appreciate that and if I feel that I'm being disrespected or whichever I'm going to stand up for myself  at times some people may be turned off for my personality because very opinionated and I say what I say what's on my mind I do not purposely going to hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature but I won't be bullied and I won't be may I Won't Back Down if I feel like I'm being challenged so  last year my mother died  so  I wish I handled that differently  it up to it that upset me  so  tell me about  I think I'm going to pass on that one too because that'll upset me more  that is terrible sometimes I sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem especially you know when you're done working and doing everything that you have to do in a day you're tired but staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because it's like I can't I get up and then I'm wide awake I'll go out and living room turn on the TV and watch TV I'm lucky if I get 3 to 4 hours sleep  are they triggered by something  maybe because I do have a lot of my mind you know thinking about bills and the stressfulness of work and in all this other stuff so that's probably a big burst part of it  but it's not difficult it's just frustrating cuz when your mind goes on overtime mode it I just affects everything your concentration your sleep you're eating  everything so  I don't look grouchy especially in the morning I'm not a morning person I like the nights but I don't like the morning that's like leave me alone until I get my first cup of coffee so other than that I'm okay  well I've been I've been depressed for quite some time and I'm still having difficulty cuz after my mother died four months later my uncle died so I had two deaths last year so I'm still reeling and trying to  get myself back together just recently I've started pursuing like interest that I used to do that I haven't done in a year because of what happened  I just I might get angry little easier I sleep alot I eat I overeat  I get tired very easily cuz I'm not getting much sleep so sometimes it's hard it seems like I'm struggling to get through the day  yes I have a psychiatrist that prescribe me medication on a regular basis  oh I was diagnosed quite some time ago probably 10 to 15 years ago and it's just something I've never gotten over I don't know whether or not you can so I've always taken the medicine  I was  arguing with everybody in my family my friends and stuff like that and I was feeling desperate and hopeless and I had attempted to take my own life years ago which caused me to be hospitalized and then they start treating me I start seeing a therapist so  well right now I'm not going to a therapist because my insurance will cover the psychiatrist and a therapist but I am working with a friend of mine who had no some Avenues to go to seek help for a therapist and I don't know if that's really going to help me I mean sometimes it depends on what kind of therapist you get sometimes people just sit there and they just listen to you talk and Ramble On and you're thinking my God what good is this and the other type is the type that will give you some kind of feedback as to how to deal with the emotions tools to help you deal with your emotions  tell  change it  they said I haven't been going to therapy recently just psychiatrist medication  there's been no changes really  I probably would be doing fine because I was doing great before my mom passed away I was her caregiver and  even though a lot of times I filled I felt overwhelmed or lacked patience with her I still was a heck of a lot happier  then I am now  tell  I would say when my son was born years ago  do you find it easy to be a parent  I'm not a parent anymore he passed away  so  and that was difficult as well  I'm extremely organized extremely reliable my work loves me because I get everything done that I'm supposed to get done even though sometimes I feel a little scatterbrained and  you know those qualities are are admirable and people that can keep their word and and be responsible  excuse me  oh I have lots of regrets  things that I've done in the past I'm not too happy about but you know I met somebody once in my life that had had that saying and you see it on a bumper sticker live to never regret so you know you can't go back and make changes it's too late so why you don't dwell on the situation but this is what I'm just a lot easier said than done  I'm at the advice kind of get person you know I don't really  give my friends ain't kind of advice I mean  I find most of the time people don't listen to you anyway so why bother I just State my opinion that's all  what right now I'm on a diet because of my overeating after my mom died I was a lot thinner when she was alive I just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot and I'll sleep eat sleep to eat and so now I'm kind of like on a diet trying to lose this weight his very unhealthy for me  I think it's been a long time  actually there's really nothing because now I just keep my mind busy I haven't been to a movie in ages I don't I used to go out shopping all the time I don't now so it's been it's been quite some time since I've been content and happy with who I am and what I'm doing in my life right now  spend your ideals  my weekends like on Saturday I'm usually working on Sunday is usually clean up day you know do your laundry clean up the house  run some errands go shopping for food you know that kind of thing so it's not if I was younger you know it would be fun you know got clubbing or whatever but I'm too old for that now  really there's nothing that I can think of  there's nothing that I can be proud of  set a good like comedy or whatever I like to watch that  sometimes my partner might do something stupid which I like because I like make fun of them  but that's it you know could maybe go out for a walk on the beach that's it  okay  no problem thank you  bye  there's somebody talk for her or she's just talking to me really  okay

367,male,1,19,are there any parameters aren't I mean is should I just talk naturally or just went wherever I'm comfortable okay I get there  one last thing  let you know when she's done I'm going to hand you the  okay  and please  are you okay with this  yes  how are you doing  I'm okay I'm a little  pensive I guess a little down but more or less okay  I was born in Annapolis Maryland on the East Coast  originally I moved because I went to film school and but then I decided to come move back to Washington DC to do some work and now I'm back here again  it's very different being from the East Coast it just has a different feel to it but living  La is very as a very different kind of attitude I guess and so it's a little difficult but I but I've gotten more used to it since I've been here  not at all when I left things got things are sort of I lost my job out there and so I had to move out here kind of quick to to be with  some people who are going to help me out and I'm just I don't know if it's strange just the right word but I'm kind of not really speaking to my family are old friends that off  it's not easy it's  it's kind of  I miss I miss a lot of people I miss my old life before I lost my job I miss some friends I miss a lot of the relationships that I had out there so it's difficult I mean it weighs on my mind a lot I feel like I failed and now I'm here and I can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard  you consider yourself more shy or outgoing  depends on the situation I think I'm out going when I'm comfortable and then I'm extremely outgoing but when I'm in a situation I'm not comfortable with this I tend to be a lot more shy so that doesn't really answer your question but  I have certain  I do I do a lot of writing I have certain music that I listen to as I'm writing and when I can when I can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world the music and the the thoughts just kind of happening really it can it soothed me it's like it's when I feel most relaxed I guess  when is the last time that happened  a few weeks ago I guess I was I've been working on a on a on a book on a novel and when I was really what I was really getting into writing it and  it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good I felt like I was accomplishing something and I was felt really relaxed  what was it about  it was about  guy who's searching for something it's  it's it's his last day on Earth and so he's going to find a person that he that he met and just  I was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes he has on Earth with her just because  certified it's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing  what made you decide to do that  well I've always I've always been a writer part of the reason I came to La was because of screenwriting so I wrote some screenplays and you know had a little bit of success with that out here and but since since that I kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and I've started to write more short stories and and longer just creative writing so I've been meaning to write a novel by just waiting for the idea that to really hit me  how hard is that  it's not easy the the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle I find it difficult I have a real love hate relationship with writing when I when I love it I just absolutely love it but sometimes I hate it because it's so difficult but it's worth it for the times when it when it's good  how are you at controlling your temper  good I don't I don't really have a temper it's not I mean most of my anger that I have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people if something is really really stressful if I'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation I can lose it but I've put probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life I mean generally I pretty much try to it when I'm upset I get upset with myself not with other people  when was the last time you argue with someone  last night I guess I got in an argument about whether or not  cleaning vegetables was necessary because of I forget but it well know it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because I'd already started cutting the vegetables and I thought that would be okay so it turned into this big argument and we did Google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and I I ended up being wrong on that one but it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow-up argument but it was a definite argument  okay  what's something you feel guilty about  lot so much  I was in a relationship that I really really better really wanted to work and  I ended up and it was partly due to I hadn't I was on that I wasn't on the right medication and so I was going like everything that sort of spiraled out of control and I feel really guilty about the way that that ended I mean I wasn't I wasn't mean but I was but I was getting more and more messed up and I couldn't stop it and it ended and so I feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not  and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again so  that was pretty that was pretty tough  you've done anything to avoid it  what some of it was was that  I wasn't medicated properly I mean now I've been to a doctor and I'm on medication that's  completely kind of I mean I still get I still get upset and I still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not I don't completely lose it for days at a time so I mean I know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if I had if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then I would have then it would have probably been different if I was who I am now then I would have I would I would be  I would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but I mean I could have  I don't know I don't know if I could have done anything different  things being how they were  I mean it's  it's possible I mean obviously  yeah because I mean that's what I do I I  take little I mean I take little things and I just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy I dwell on stuff and it's like any little detail that comes up I suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day I mean I still I still get I still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed and I feel ashamed about stuff that I did in high school which was years and years ago I which I shouldn't even be thinking about anymore cuz it's so in the past but I still get that feeling like I'm right back there  that sounds really hard  well it's not easy I've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it I mean I dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to slow my mind down that way but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better  well like I said I do a lot of you know if I'm if I'm writing or if I'm doing anything like I kind of have to almost  you doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely if I'm watching TV I have to be playing a game on my phone if I'm using the computer I have to be you know watching a TV show or a movie on you know on it in another window so that I can just keep my mind occupied during all that  I just need I mean I I wish that I could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but I just I can't yet  I need triggered by something  they're triggered by everything pretty much anything that I said I see if I if I if I hear somebody with a Dutch last name if I if I hear somebody talk about Wisconsin if I hear you know she will talk about  anyting you know I can reach back and connect to  to this it's really it's really  I don't know that's the thing I mean I don't ever get a break  from it  now  how easy is it for  I'm a very light sleeper so I'm awake and asleep and awake and is I have no problem going back to sleep but I generally you know don't  I don't know I'd never really needed much sleep so it's just only recently that I've really started to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep like I would I would usually stay up until 2 or 3 in the morning so that I could just be so exhausted that I would just calling out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work but now it's it's it's like if I do that I can't I still don't get enough sleep I don't clock out I still just sleep very lightly you know I get up I toss and turn all night you know and now  it's just it's  yeah I don't sleep too great right now  pretty I mean I don't know it's hard to it's hard to know I usually just kind of power through it and just I'm at I'm like how I am now I just I just feel bad  okay  how long ago were you diagnosed  I think  334 years ago  it was when I  I had been given taking stuff for anxiety for 4  years before that but then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you actually got this situation and we need to get you the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so  so yeah that was that was kind of a turning point but unfortunately it happened after everything went bad so  at the moment I don't know I don't really think I thought about it too much then but looking back on it I feel  it really makes me angry it really makes me you know given where I am right now it makes me really angry that I'm  that I had that I I lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain because of things that I couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me I mean I was paying I was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing it you know it wasn't  it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know I managed to find somebody who did work and I just yeah so I'm I'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now  there really wasn't any choice I had to I was I was a mess I was it was either  I was I was self-medicating it was affecting my work I mean it was everything was just there was a point where I really realized that I mean I just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and and all this stuff you know they just decided that I was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off  but it was at least that and not  firing me but but but yeah but so I got help but it was  but it wasn't soon enough  not not as much as I should  I go to a couple of meetings I go to I go to AA so that I can you know keep control of that aspect to 2 and there's a there's a therapy aspect that unfortunately you know being unemployed my unemployment ran out you know I'm time you know what I'm getting my medication from the city of La so you know I'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody so I have a psychiatrist that I go see but it's really  very I've only seen her three times in the past year so basically to keep my medication coming  then there's you  right  changes have you noticed  well like I said I mean  this the top I mean let's just take the AAA for example because that's probably the close closest for that I'm seeing with therapy right now just saying stuff out loud is just like getting getting the stuff out trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense  that you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a a therapist or just a room full of of drugs you know I mean you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something that you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing  you know better than I that I have been I mean  it is sort of a good it has its ups and downs you know I'm applying for jobs 5-6 jobs or more a day you know I never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to 2 to being self-sufficient again it's hard but that's like real world problems I feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control so now it's just I have to deal with real life witches  Jazz at the juices don't own challenge  it was probably you know a couple of years ago  I was I mean the thing that immediately comes to mind is everything was going well at my job I was making these great videos with this person that I ate that I was having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a Christmas tree  and we spent it all this time picking out the perfect Christmas tree and it was just  feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger  the bigger life  that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel  you know for that instant I felt like  a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and  I mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant I felt like a normal person a normal happy person and  part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that  I don't know if I'll ever feel that again  so  what are you most proud of in your life  probably the  probably this educate educational series I did educational video series I did for the National Science Foundation  it was it was really hard and it would but in the end it turned out really good and you know I'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about  in about the world around them so that I feel like that was a real contribution that I made to the world  I was part of you know it's part of my my job it was it was a we were trying to come up with with new ideas for because we were put together videos and stuff to give you know to two schools and everything and they had done this before but we decided to do something really big you know when there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of  and there was a lot to it and so it was probably the biggest  project that the NSF has decided to do and so we just kind of produced it  I guess  I don't know I don't know it's been awhile it's been awhile since I've since I've really thought about that I don't know what I'd go somewhere would I  I don't know  thank you  Audi

353,female,1,11,yes  i'm okay  um pennsylvania  mhm um well i was in boston for a couple years and then i moved here about three and a half years ago but um i just wasn't satisfied with the quality of my life um maybe once or twice last year i only got to back once a year um definitely safer and um definitely a more um well i just miss it 'cause i have a lot of family back there but l_a is okay i i mean everyone loves the climate here um  not too easy i have two really good friends here and i have a boyfriend i've been with for three years so that helps he's from here but um it definitely took a a bit of adjustment  no um advertising communications  um no i'm currently working in actually i'm not working right now at the moment um i wanna be an osteopathic physician  um so basically versus western medicine an osteopathic physician is someone who helps someone with the symptoms and doesn't just treat the symptoms but treats them as a whole person so they look at nutrition they look at diet exercise um just a variety of things to <t> to actually get someone to live  a healthier life versus medications or things that are commonly prescribed now in the western medicine  um well one of the great things was when i came out here to l_a i was um exposed to the degree which i had never heard of living on the east coast   um sometimes  um well i'm very particular about the people i like to surround myself with um and eh i don't like to socialize with a lot of people i mean i tend to um like small intimate groups and i don't tend to like to be in larger or bigger groups um eh when people don't take into account other people's feelings  um i usually  try to go for a walk if i get <laughter> very irritated  um i'm usually really good it really takes a lot for me to spill over and to yell or become upset   um <sigh> let's see uh mm i was at with my lawyer and it was about his handling of my case  yeah it was he's uh they're i don't know i think they're just a little bit mediocre they're not the best lawyers   i have no idea <laughter>  um i'm very trustworthy i'm loyal um i care very deeply so i i like to try to help other people um and i always like to try to cheer people up so <laughter> i think that's that would be some of 'em  no yes  um just a few months ago about in the last six months  um i was experiencing  mental issues that i'd never really came across before paranoia and anxiety and i knew that it wasn't  um i knew that i it wasn't that i couldn't overcome it by myself  um a lot better i've been doing a lot of yoga and meditation um kinda seeing things from a different per view or another <ano> not per <pe> per view but a different view and um  that's helped but there's definitely times where i kind of sink back into thinking about the event especially because the event caused me to stop working   um  i think i you know i have a difficulty being in public um i'm still dealing with anxiety and paranoia about that and that something may happen so um so a lot of times during the day is when it happened so i'm not that comfortable going out during the day i tend to go out in the mornings and evenings and um i don't like to go into places where there's only one way in and one way out um well i've been gradually trying to increase how much i'm outside um  and i usually just deep breathing um i do a lot of breathing exercises and i just try to say that basically what i'm thinking or what's going on with me is not real um and that   i just i try <laughter> i just try to get myself to go into these places more gradually a lot better since uh the last couple months but before i very much pretty much stayed home    um  it's been good um it's been good to hear someone's feedback but um i feel like i've gotten more help with just my inner talk with just kind of sitting with myself and journaling  i do  um <sigh> well i feel like more like myself which is a huge improvement um and i am more cautious and er guarded in some ways about my thoughts um and about my decisions as well i'm not so i'm not so oh you know i'll just do this and not really think of the consequences of other things that i want in my life   um it's gotten better i'm okay <ok> i'm better now um the first three months it was very difficult i couldn't sleep through the night and i woke maybe two or three times and would be awake for a couple hours but now i am um sleeping through the night again  um i feel <f> groggy <sigh> k i feel foggy and out of it um  and just low kind of depressed  mm <sigh> it's um i think it's been awhile  um working <laughter> i'm a bit of a workaholic um spending time with my family um yeah just being outside enjoying nature reading um very close  what is that  um scrubbed_entry um well my parents 'cause they've always been very supporting and loving um giving me feedback about my decisions or what i'm choosing to do but allowing me to make my own um decisions my own choices in life and then  my sisters have just always been very um you know just always checking with me i'm the baby i'm the youngest in the family so they always um  looking out for me and just checking in with me and then my boyfriend xxx with this um incident that happened um he's been very uh usually supportive with just letting me kind of have my talk and work things out and understanding when i'm feeling and not wanting to go out in public and and being aware of that that it's not so easy for me just to do something like grocery shop or um running errands without having a lot of anxiety  um i'm most proud of  the jobs the work that i've done the people i've helped um  maybe that i took this job where i was assaulted at <laughter> that would be it going into retail into unsafe environment not listening to my gut  um  what advice would i what uh to recklessly pursue your dreams um that there is no such thing as too late or running out of time and and to enjoy every moment of your life not take anything for granted  um  let's see uh <sigh> well cooking i really enjoy <enj> i really enjoy cooking um  so i made some roasted vegetables just any time i'm cooking i just really enjoy it um we have a garden so we had collard greens that came up and um some chilis and cauliflower so just using preparing that for <f> um for my um boyfriend and i  mhm bye thanks 
421,female,1,10,doorbell back over here  alright great thank you  and please  are you okay with  yes that's fine  I'm okay how are you  originally I'm from San Francisco  originally I moved here in gosh 1995 then I went to Chicago then to San Francisco and then back to Los Angeles probably about 5 years ago  a lot of moving  never  there just isn't anything there for me anymore  the weather is better in LA but the people in San Francisco are nicer  my husband prefer my ex-husband prefers at here that's why we moved  okay  I have an undergraduate degree in Psychology and after that I went to law school  when I was in college I worked at a law firm and decided that I really wanted to be a lawyer it was really interesting  are you still working in that no now I'm a stay-at-home mom  you find it easy to be a parent know I loved it but it is it is difficult you have to manage a life to make sure that they become a good and successful person  it's easy to kind of do the academics and stuff like that you know I'm good at that the hardest thing I think is to guide them emotionally to help him through things that he's having a hard time with feeling like I don't have all the answers  I'm just seeing them grow and and experience new things and learn about life in the world it's just it's really really cool  what are some ways that your  completely different completely different and I am not a perfect parent but I love my son I take care of him he's the first priority in my life and they weren't like that at all  well my parents are dead I didn't speak to my dad at all before he died I have a sister and a brother that actually I don't know where they are I don't speak to them either  do you consider yourself more shy  probably more shy because I consider myself more reserved  I like to listen to music  like what I have I listen to all sorts of music but my favorite when I'm relaxing is that 80s music cheesy cheesy but true  it depends on who I'm with if I'm with my son I can control my temper if I'm with my ex-husband or other adults yeah I don't  so so  yesterday and it was about my ex-husband dating the woman that he was cheating on when we were married  can you tell me about that  I found out he was cheating on me and I kicked him out and he told me yesterday that he's continuing to date her  yeah  really angry  and just really hurt  I wish that I had talked to my dad before he died I wish that I had settled our differences before he had died  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to  the hardest decision I've ever had to make was actually ending my marriage  because he was cheating on me  that would have to be  well I don't know I mean I don't know if I'd want to erase anything from my memory because it makes me who I am today  but I can't really think of one event that I would want to erase  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep I don't get a good night sleep it's not easy I wake up a lot in the night  I don't know I wish I knew if I knew I could change it I could try to do something about it but I I just don't I don't know  what are you like when you don't  grumpy irritable  grumpy irritable down  mixed with anger  can you tell me about  it's just because of everything that I'm going through with my soon-to-be ex-husband  yeah there's  I just keep it inside  Meador Staffing else to really do except I mean it is what it is so  I have to  deal with it  no  yes  10 years ago after my son was born  9 years ago I felt like I couldn't cope with life  I was so down I couldn't I felt like I couldn't do anything  I need  no  I don't go to therapy I go to medication management but I don't do talk therapy  I have gone to a therapist and no they don't help  can you tell me if  well some just sit and stare at you and don't say anything you know if I wanted to talk to myself I would others give advice that I think is just  it just not not good and not on point  tell me about the last time you felt  it was probably this morning I was playing with my son  just really happy I wasn't thinking about  any of the other crap  in my life I could just forget it so I was feeling really really happy  I think they would describe me completely different from the way I would describe me but I think they would describe me as really sweet they have really sweet confident  outgoing because that's what I try to be two people so I think that's how they would describe me  I wish I wasn't sad I wish I was more confident  yeah there are a lot of things I think  it would be  to not  not give my life over to one particular person which is what I did with my husband  find your ideal weekend  I think I would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like Palm Springs with my son hanging around the pool having fun going out to dinner  one of my two of my friends to really good girlfriend so I think have been really positive influences in my life  can you tell me if  sure life is worse than mine and the but we can always commiserate together  is just really positive me she's always happy always up always look into the bright side so that has helped me a lot  my son  I went over to a friend's house and we had movie night we watch the grown up movie and had dinner and wine and the boys were in another room watching movies and playing video games and it was just a relaxed fun evening  thanks for sharing your thoughts with me  my  okay
383,male,0,7,"it's kind of fun this weekend  okay  cool thank you  and please  are you okay with  yeah I'm totally fine it be confidential or not you know my words everybody's get wild  I'm doing pretty good hanging out nice weather I just had a recent change of feeling just now looking at you the digital you that I'm saying I don't know if it's yeah it's funny  because I'm just always thought that the conveying of emotions or feelings  do you like better understood with a human interaction as opposed to a non-human entity such as yourself  yeah  I think you see what I mean I'm from born and raised in Los Angeles Venice area marvista specifically that's where I'm from  well  a lot more that I don't like but what I do like is that public transportation is coming up  that's the idea of certain you know medical drugs like marijuana is a prevalent in a topic very thought upon and I feel that Los Angeles is deep culture is why I stay here and pursue my art because there's a lot to that's a lot to gain from the different communities if you understand yeah  well the  the human mentality here is  is very is very hectic very chaotic in a lot due to the vehicle the car the freeway and this idea that were on a grind you know this yeah it's it's a very it's very hectic atmosphere human atmosphere that is not very conducive for a supporting Living Community to help each other out kind of thing  well I can't see your shoes but I love to travel I do love hiking I do love surfing swimming biking riding taking rides I do love to travel you  I'm from my travels it's not like well I do enjoy a lot of things about travel but it's more like what do I it's it's just more like I enjoy not being trapped in the city with all these made up ties and restraints I enjoy traveling because I get to see the world as it really is instead of this photo image in a man-made image that it is here so I love traveling because I get to get out of this and see the world as it is  thanks  would you  okay well I am  kind of recently last year went to Los Banos Central California area and although it wasn't that far from LA it was completely different energy out there is no phones there's no Wi-fi there's no TV there was there was sanity there was a Relative Insanity in the sense that people weren't diluted and getting all of this input from digital media and outer influence people are just real real and hiking and chilling I was working in a Hot Spring Resort  and I just got to breathe and hike and farm and do a lot of carpentry  I'm not hard you don't you don't even think about difficulty when you're doing things you truly love and enjoy so it wasn't  I guess  kind of what I described about the city I just wanted to get out of here and  kind of just get out of here really and just experienced the real the real deal  I'm well  currently I'm studying  currently I'm studying Physical Therapy I'm about to become licensed massage therapist but before that yeah it kind of cool but before that I was going to  I'm for music composition so I was just writing scores for films animations dance Productions theater Productions stuff like that trippie trippie it is cool but I had to leave that because tuition hikes up to you now going up to like 50 thousand a year for like a four-year BF not not the deal not trying to trap myself with these chains of Federal loans  so yeah  hey that's not a good word sex  dream job  my dream job would be  anyting  that I can do to alleviate these Metropolitan like cities from the nightmare that they've been put in my dream is to alleviate the nightmare my dream is to incite dream back within the modern human worlds and within a physical therapy and artistic expression I've got some  great ideas yeah  I guess my ago and I just like I just like experiencing things so outgoing yeah  I thought that was really funny what I do to relax is  can I Breathe It Out chill maybe make it smoothie or some tea I'm going to go bike riding rides  pretty good I guess I haven't yelled in a long time  when was the  what wasn't arguing I don't I don't really argue much I just like to save my opinion and have it be understood and I like the person I'm conversing with to say their opinion and have it understood so the last time that happened was  I guess yesterday chilling in downtown with a friend from New York and we're talking about riding and basically we were not arguing but talking about opinions in that sometimes things are not ready to be written  yeah so yesterday  Kelty  stuff I haven't had that feeling in a long time guilt what about you what something you feel guilty about  okay  I don't really wish I could erase anything from my memory cuz then that would just be like I would feel something was lacking from my current present life if something just got erased hang a butterfly effect, like yeah  maybe the time  I'm sure she was going to school I was taking the year off and I was just kind of hanging around but we had an apartment together with another friend and it didn't turn out  you know not all nothing turns out as it start to be and that's kind of a beautiful thing about it but this one turned out a little  a little different actually quite different than I thought it would be in I thought it was funny but yet ended up on me leaving before the lease ended and I'd actually ended up here with the separating but that's something I wish maybe I handled a little more thoughtfully  the hardest decision  maybe maybe not hard disk but a hard decision to make was leaving school dropping my continuation of achieving a BFA  yeah that could have been the hardest  Chester I don't  I mean of course money money is the motto money is a big issue tuition hikes going around the whole nation not a fan of that not a fast not a fan of support that but  yeah that's probably one of the biggest reasons why I just don't support these crazy tuition ax going around and  but another reason why I  decided to leave at to make a hard decision to decide to leave was also because the Art Institute you know that's it the funny idea and itself already and basically I was a musician  being taught by a musician  to make music and same with you know all that of the dancers or the theater students you know getting taught dance to to a dancer from a dancer how to dance you know and it's just  yeah it's just not quite as artistic as I thought art would be our art comes from somewhere summersweet and deepen purple and not not from out there he knows so yeah  okay  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  if I  if I am  it's kind of easy I mean it depends you know if I remember to make some chamomile tea or fi  remember to breathe and go through my Montresor  remember to do my pre like dream therapy work then I can get into a real nice but if I just get diluted with all my thought that it takes a long time until I remember to breathe yeah  I'm yeah basically just what I said just breathing or you know if I'm hanging out with friends coming home late and if I get the lucky chance to be medicated from you know a nice and I send a car then it really does you know it Indica does put me down pretty nice pretty drowsy so a lot of things breathing you know in a medical herbs like chamomile and cannabis and  just a going believe in myself of bad bad juju  I guess not if I can't think of something now  I've been feeling  kind of like kind of like this kind of just cruising on a on a gray line but it's a nice grey it's really nice hue  some people wouldn't like this but I really like that and it says it's stable  that sits comfortable yeah  no no I haven't  not by a certified medical professional now but now I haven't  can you tell me about  yeah I mean I just think like the whole you know like you said PTSD depression and you know other in a mental instabilities I think everybody is depressed I think everybody is Overjoyed I think everybody's angry and everybody shy everybody social all at the same time you know it's just different days different you know variance different floats different boats you know different waves different swells so yeah I think  I'm depressed I think I'm really happy I think I'm really angry I think I'm really friendly you know all that but just on different very different floats  really happy  I am going to feel really happy a lot and I feel really sad a lot but really happy was yes maybe this morning when I was just biking over here enjoying the sun enjoying the breeze biking  yeah it is  well a lot of best friends and they prescribed me all pretty differently but underlying that same idea and maybe I'm just maybe in a nutshell just kind of Aquarius and I guess  okay  advice would you give yourself  well I'm 21 so 20 years ago I would have told myself to keep being a baby stay young  and don't lose sight you know don't stop listening keep letting things happen don't make them happen b b a beautiful baby that's what I would have told myself yeah be a beautiful baby  my cat's recently what has been shown to me through Me By Me is my ability to work with others in a manner of speaking in artistic standpoint

346,female,1,23,yes  i'm okay  here in los angeles  there's a lot of things to do i love the beach  um i love the i love that it's sunny all the time  um the amount of people  um  that's really about it the amount of people  just a little  i just like um going to new places and just discovering new things  um i recently went to new york i was there for about three months  um and it was extremely boring i went to western new york  um and it was extremely uh snowy and um  i didn't <didn> was in a position where i didn't have a car so i didn't get to go very many places and i was in a small town   so um  i uh  uh it was beautiful for what i got to see but really  it wasn't really much to it <laughter>  yeah  um  both i'm both an introvert and an extrovert  um  i really enjoy doing things by myself  um  i um have a lot of my own um my likes and dislikes and i've spent a lot of time alone even though um i have <ha> i do have a lot of friends and uh when i do go out i i do tend to meet a lot of people but um i also enjoy um being by myself a lot  um  probably outgoing creative um  talented  um fun trustworthy  um  i studied language um  and um physics  and um  math no i'm not  i'm actually um i'm um i'm trying to be an actress  it was something that i fell into when i was a teenager  scrubbed_entry and uh i really enjoyed doing it and i hadn't done it for years um  so i figured why not i just came back to california and might as well try something that i did enjoy really doing   um so far um i just got picked up by an agent  so i haven't really done anything yet as an adult  but um  i'm hoping  hoping something it'll be fruitful   um  <sigh> i really don't haven't had too many  um  i guess my sister she's done really well  um  my boyfriend he's a  he's a very positive human being  um  but um  really i haven't had too many positive influences  um  i'm close i mean we <w> we hang out um i i don't tell them everything  um they're kind of judgmental  but um  other than that i mean i mean we hang out i mean i see them every day  um  geez um  it's kinda hard for me to relax um i mean i try to watch t_v um and i read  a lot um  that's probably about it i read i do a lot of sleeping <laughter> i'm a little depressed so um  yeah it's kinda it's xxx like i said it's really hard for me to relax  um  it isn't  um i tend to think a lot  um about the things that stress me out  um i've been through a lot of a lot of stuff so um  yeah so i i don't i don't i don't sleep very well at night and if i do fall asleep i wake up all through the night usually with some kind of anxiety attacks  um  i dream a lot about um the stuff that has uh  has affected me throughout the years so um  it's usually you know like i i'll dream about something that stressed me out and then i'll wake up and my my chest'll hurt    um  or just i just can't sleep all night because i just think i seem to be i don't know if i'm afraid to go to sleep  but i uh <sigh> i just i don't know i feel like that <th> that's a vulnerable place for me  because of stuff that've happened to me  so um  i i so i sleeping is just not really something i do well  um  tired  i'm uh  i'm moody i'm very sensitive  um  i uh i'm just negative <ne> a negative person  um which really that's not me um  i uh yeah i'm like <l> judgmental is not me either um i just  i'm just not a not a nice person to be around  um  i try to <t> i i spend a lot of my time reading i try to go out and do um i force myself to go out and do things um  just to keep myself involved  um so that i don't uh sit <si> just sit around and and and dwell on the fact that i can't sleep and i i try to um get myself as exhausted as i possibly can  um by running around and and and doing things  so  um it's difficult  um i do like there is a part of me that doesn't wanna  i don't really wanna go out and do things i have to actually force myself to um if i have make appointments i uh  i make appointments to like for auditions or or um  even to do this i um i i tend to uh  just not  like at the last minute i'll i'll try to convince myself not to go <laughter> but then i force myself to anyways   yes  um i've been diagnosed for two instances  um i was diagnosed <dia> diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago  and then i was diagnosed again um in august um  the first time it was um  i just wasn't sleeping <sl> because of the not sleeping um   and the uh just the stress <st> the unbelievable stress  um  and then the second time it was a xxx uh once again i started with the not sleeping um and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me um  and i just i i just couldn't take it anymore  so i i figured um  i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um  not thinking life was worth it and and i i i that's i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated  yeah  it was  i no <n> do not um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um  get out of my environment  um and uh  and that seemed to help a lot  um  and uh out here i i was i just the counselors that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much  um they just  they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and i don't believe that that's what i needed  um  yeah so um  yeah  <sigh> stressed um uh lately i've been really sad and i don't know why   um  but like i said i've been trying to combat that by um   keeping myself busy  um  actually um  i'm kind of a couple days ago  i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy   um but then i went back to  being you know going back to feeling miserable  so um  well i realized  i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep  and um  i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky  um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me  and uh  you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that  and that made me really happy  um  yeah  thank you <laughter> oh geez um  i've had so many years of just  just bad just a lot of bad  that it there has it's been a long time  since i've been proud of anything  i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through  um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've  gotten rid of themselves a long time ago  but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um  there's gotta be a silver lining  so  um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh  i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people  and um  and truthful and i still i still have drive in me  yeah  ugh <sigh> so much um  my last marriage um not getting out when i should have  um  and uh just i regret a lot <sigh> um the any situation that would've had a red flag um  eh just get out of it you know eh some things just don't work and um  no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um  i i would tell myself um to um  that it's not selfish  to let go of a bad situation  and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself  so if had i known that then had had i known that then i i i probably would've done better in life so  yeah  <sigh> um people who um  when people are down on me for my faults  um that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people steal still relive when i'm trying to forgive myself um  people who are mean to other people uh people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy um just anybody who picks on the little guy  um  you know people who don't care about the environment or animals um  i just <jus> i think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be  and uh it's it's disheartening and it it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make um everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do  and uh i that makes me mad  <laughter> i vent <laughter> um  yeah i tend to vent and then uh  and them um and then it's usually over i try not to bad mouth people um i try to just talk through it until um until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore mm i try not to get angry um  because i have a really bad temper and it um  and it can get outta hand so um  what i do is i i <laughter> something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap  um <laughter> if i'm not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap um i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind and come back to it  um  it was a couple days ago it was actually with my mother um  it was about um  actually she thought that i had taken a shirt from her  and um she was screaming and yelling at me and um  i was i was tired um i was it was late and um  i started to yell at <a> back at her you know because i was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty um  and you <yo> <sigh> it's uh going back to my past you know when i was younger and you know i didn't care about you know people's things and i would just kinda take and do whatever i wanted to and i'm not i'm so far from that person   um and i it it hurt me so i got mad and i and i started to yell and argue  mm kinda petty and stupid but  at the time it it seemed  it seemed uh  viable  um  hmm one of my most memorable experiences  um  god <go> i've had so many um  maybe it was um  i don't know um  it was  probably um  graduating pharmacy school  um i felt pretty great i didn't know if i was doing  uh very very well or not um and i ended up getting like on my last test scores i getting <get> ended up getting like ninety eight percent  and um  i uh  i actually i didn't <did> i had no confidence <laughter> that i had done well in class in school at all and i i didn't even know how i was getting the grades i was getting um so that was a really big accomplishment for me um  and uh yeah that was a great it was a great memory yeah  yeah  um  i'm reliable  um  i um  i'm talented  um i i'm a good listener um  i'm always there to help people  um  i tend to always try to do the right thing  um  sometimes actually i forget that i have any good qualities but  um  and just  i uh  all around i try to be you know as as good and the best person that i can be to other people and myself um  yeah  um  going to comedy shows  um  just um  having moments where you just laugh with people  um  sometimes just reading puts me in a good mood uh  i don't know probably that's about it  uh huh  okay  thank you  bye
474,male,0,4,cool  all right  cool thanks  hi I'm Ali thanks for coming in today  yes  I'm good how are you  I was born in Hawaii but I grew up in Colorado  yeah yeah  how about some 7 to 8 years ago  I should go back once it once or twice a year  it's  how does it compare to La it's it's different it's not as busy there's more things to do outdoors in the mountains on my fan  for work  yeah I am I love it here  it took about a year before I really felt comfortable but once they got through that kind of hard year it was pretty good out here but a good time  I love that I can go to the beach I love that it's warm most of the time I love that I've met a lot of people that love the Arts as much as I do  the traffic just like everyone else yeah  yeah this traffic and it's pretty much just traffic earthquakes  not as much as I'd like  it's just nice to go someplace new experience something different  I want to hear that  I went to Alaska couple years ago and that was really awesome I got to go fishing in the ocean and I got seasick that was an awesome but it was cool I saw a bear in real life a bear walk through a yard is really different than La was way cool  English creative writing  well I always wanted to tell stories so it just made sense to work on riding and somehow some aspect  yeah I am  to have my own TV show where I write it and everyone watches it every week and it's awesome  really hard  cuz there's a lot of people that have the same dream so  yeah  more outgoing than shy  I like talking to people enjoy other people  take screensaver  go to the movies or turn on music dance  pretty good  I was at work couple about a month ago about a month ago I got mad at someone because I didn't think they were they were giving me clear instructions and so when I try to have a conversation about it they got mad and then I got mad and we got mad  I felt like I wasn't being heard or listen to and felt like we weren't able to have a real dialogue so because we couldn't have a dialogue I felt like no one was listening to me  totally  no ragrets  I yes  I don't know if there is one I mean I'm sure there is but one time I was driving behind someone and they will they cut me off and I think it's just been one of those days this was like a year ago or two years ago it's just one of those days where I just didn't want or I just been a frustrating day when this person cut me off and I almost got an accident with them I just followed them to their parking spot and actually I'd haunted them and they they flipped me off and so she's really really going to my skin would cut me off and almost caused an accident and then and then flipped me off so I followed them to the spa and I asked said Miss why did you put me off when you cut me off and and she said oh you know I'm I've had a rough day I don't need your attitude and her daughter was with her and I told her well you're not releasing a very good example for your daughter and you know I didn't need to be Petty like that but I just I wanted to be a guess  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to  get you going deep is the hardest decision was coming out to my mom telling her I was gay I mean it wasn't hard cuz it was the right one but it was hard to do because my mom is very conservative and she she had trouble accepting and it it took a while but when she did you know everything is better and I knew it would be but it was just hard in the moment to you know tell her something she don't want to hear  when I was little kid my  my grandfather found our dog run over in there on the road and he  and brought it in and buy them over as a kid just like seeing death like that really just threw me off and frighten me and I was just one of those moments but like I guess I wish I hadn't been there for it because my grandmother was destroyed she was just so sad and she was woman's I guess you need as a kid but I didn't really want to experience like losses like that in your face  our relationship and our family is pretty good we find out as close as most but we do know we was we don't talk often but we talked with love and we always love each other when we see each other  my grandmother was very positive she was always very encouraging and told me to you know pursue my dreams and not to let little things get me down so glad I had her  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep usually it's easy sometimes it's not  wife in between jobs recently I start a new job next week but while I've been off I haven't been working I tend to like my body wants to stay up later and later and later and I'm trying not to like fall into the pattern of going to sleep at like 2 or 3 and getting up at like 11 so I keep trying to make myself go to sleep by like midnight or 12:30 and I just end up laying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half and I should be I should I should be able to just go to sleep and get up at like 9 but  I want to stay up I guess  a little scatterbrained like today I'm a little scatterbrained cuz I I tried to go to sleep early again and I ended up tossing and turning and  so scatterbrained  most of the had a lot of time on my hands like I don't usually have this much time on my hands so sometimes it can be frustrating because you don't know what to do with it when you're not working I guess but  yeah I think that's the question  I just thought maybe a little more absent-minded than usual just lately with the the not working thing  no  a couple days ago when I got my new job I got hired  outgoing listening attentive fun loyal  Bank  help  I wish that I  I probably should have looked better I wish I had more hair up here losing a little bit if I wish I was a little skinnier this is girdles pretty tight and you know sometimes I wish I had more money but  nothing too drastic I'm okay  yeah  hoo  when I was a little kid I was I was the fly was the fat kid and remember I was like I was going to high school and it was like the second day and I remember this guy came up to me and was like he was like pretty nice to me I thought midnight realize he'd like this like out of a movie right here put Band-Aids on my back that's it like I'm a fat cow until like like yeah like just a bunch of mean stuff and I didn't know I walked around with it for like half an hour people laughing I didn't get it and then find this girl is going to me and was like hey there's like Band-Aids on your back that's Kelly's mean things and then she just walked away she didn't like help me take them off and I remember like I couldn't get them I was trying to find him and then I just never liked putting my head in my locker and like I didn't want anyone to see me cry so I just like what made out of my locker and like pretend like I was looking at stuff my backpack but really I was going to know  the crying fat kid who can get the mean stickers off his back  anyting  probably  yeah  you know  I would I would try to keep trying to let myself know 2 to look at things positively and not like we would have people think about you and I spent too much time as like a adolescent worrying what people thought of me and as I got older I didn't care as much and I start enjoying life a lot more so  I went to Coachella it's a music festival it was 3 days with all of my friends and my boyfriend and we we danced and me went swimming and we barbecued and we laughed and had a great time  oh I guess my MyCareer humble as it may be I really stuck in La a long time when it was when like it was hard I stay I stuck around it and quit so and I'm proud that I've managed to like follow my dreams and really stay out here and try to make it in Hollywood  thanks for sharing  my pleasure  bye  bye  that was fun  okay
377,female,1,16,"so when she's finished I'll just wait for a little more buttons not working I'm pleased  are you okay  yeah go ahead  okay  I grew up in Wisconsin and I lived in Colorado for a bit and then they lived overseas for a little while and then I move to California  I moved here at the end of June of last year so I guess it's been 8 months something like that  at the most probably twice a year  Well my own town is all of 5,000 people and there are a lot of cows and barns and Farms so the opposite of LA  good question I have always wanted to live in California so but I had to living in in the Central Coast  and I just have been coming down to La like once a month for different business and that working and personal development stuff so yeah things were changing in Santa Cruz for me that client I had who is really the main like Financial  Main Financial Source I had that relationship ended so I was totally free to move and I thought well I guess I'll give Ally a try and see what happens so  I give it a shot and here I am  no not at all very very big city  I lived in Dublin in Ireland was it which is also a big city but you know European cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy and  yeah so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging and  I'm not much of a world Explorer. I love to travel I love it I live in Ireland and I traveled by the Morocco and I was in Costa Rica on my spend some time in Mexico so yeah  I love meeting new people experiencing new cultures and like also not just seeing what's different but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go  I want to hear about one of your trips  sure well  I guess trying to think which is my favorite time of night there's amazing things about Morocco and Costa Rica both but Morocco's incredible it was like 12 days and we went to three different locations we went up in the atlas mountains are beautiful and  yeah it's a really really cool culture that was fun  my trip to Ireland I actually visited there which is why I decided to move there so my most memorable moment of that trip probably dozens but the first most memorable moment of that trip was being in a bison and leaving Dublin and going to sound to the countryside and seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is time is everyone is these pictures of Ireland or you know you see in films and it's green and Lush and gorgeous but you actually get there and experienced it it's like the pictures don't do it justice so incredible  I might have an undergrad degree in English and psychology and a psychology minor and I have a master's degree in women's studies  no I use my English in Psychology I work in marketing Communications so actually do sales so yeah the psychology definitely comes in to comes into play and so does my  I guess my undergrad degree in English but really like I took that on and and created something out of it because most people who get an English degree just teach and I I wasn't wanting to teach  what made you decide to do  too cuz I'm not clear on the question  okay  my job  wow  yeah my dream job is  being a  a motivational speaker and trainer and coach  I'm in traveling the world doing that and impacting people's lives and really contributing to people  my relationships pretty good actually I  I just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who would not she was sporadic I saw her sporadically growing up I lived my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and they had two kids together so I grew up and I consider them like the family I grew up with so but I got in communication with my biological mother  last May and we've been  clear things up and have been in communication since then  well not sure what you mean but if you're referring to being communication with my birth mother is very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and they do not just the future but in the present moment with her so yeah  I'm shy  time to relax I do a number of things I like to do yoga and I don't have the money for it right now I love to dance I love to read I love to go to the ocean and spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions that really retarded is my battery actually probably more than anything else  I like to be with friends I love arts and trying new restaurants  yeah all those things are  both relaxing and I guess they're relaxing in the sense that I feel connected to the people in my life and today experiences of my life so  yeah  how are you at controlling your temper  depends if I'm driving not very good but otherwise I'm pretty good at it  last night I argued with somebody probably would have to be  Ono is with the LA times that the newspaper delivery  yeah that was the last time  tell me about  yeah the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that I take care of it didn't show up and I didn't realize that it wasn't there until  I'm late I don't know afternoon I think early afternoon and then I called them and they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after 10:30 in the morning which is absurd to me when they made a mistake in the first place so I mean for service at and it would pay for it for every day so I'm yeah I was just really irritated and then I found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so amazing Ricky L E X I was angry with people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me I was pretty frustrated  Noel there quite a few of those  I think about 1  the other day I had a phone call  and I'm going to coaching program and  it was from one of the coaches in the program and she was explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls cuz we have one particular coach we work with and then she called to tell me that I was going to have another coaching call with  someone who's not my couch and that hasn't been explained to me it's part of the program so it's in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my God I have all these people I have to be accountable to and you know I have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just  so yeah I wasn't  I was an angry I was just I just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and I talked it out with her and we got through it but  yeah I could have  certainly just been okay with what for was being asked of me in the at that time and would have made the call go a lot smoother  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make  large decision while there's been a few  why is moving to Ireland was probably the hardest decision now it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was challenging  that was the hardest decision was the first time that I  moved away from my family I was 28 and I decided to I chose to move to Colorado and that's a pretty tough decision at that point my family had been within an hour's Drive of where I lived an hour hour-and-a-half and now they're going to be a 12-hour drive away or a plane right away so that was challenging  oh lots of things  I love Colorado Colorado is beautiful beautiful state and the weather is so much better than Wisconsin and at the time I was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor outdoor community in Colorado so they were a lot more people who were in my age group and or single that was another factor and we're interested in the things I was interested in so Colorado to seem like a really natural fit hell yeah and then I found a job that I liked the pay was atrocious but I found some work that was really rewarding and that all came together just move  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  I was totally unrelated question  relatively easily it just depends on like what time I go to sleep if I'm out and I don't get home until 11:30 then  and having to go to bed late and I wake up feeling tired like I feel today but generally I can sleep through the night I've had some pretty anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks but even so even when I wake up from those are five-star from those I still can fall back to sleep relatively easily  I'm sure they are I mean I'm in another transition state and moving out of  out of the house that I live in right now or take care of an elderly woman  yeah and I just I have to find  the financial means to support me in doing that and it's and she creates a lot of anxiety just didn't her state of being anxious exhausting and I'd really depressing  living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing I've ever done and I would never ever choose to do it again if I honestly if I knew what I was getting into I don't think I would have said yes to the situation  I feel trapped and helpless like this nothing I can  no way out of the situation that I'm in no matter what I do it doesn't get any better I did I don't know I'm not getting any kind of work that I want to do and my money's not working at all  so yeah I feel pretty crappy  I have in the past year  oh a long time I was 15 I think 14 so it was over 20 years ago  are you suicidal  you feel down  oh yeah I fell down  I don't actually now  well I originally stopped  with my therapist because we had completed I mean we had worked on what needed to be worked on and I was no longer depressed and and then I began therapy again later on think I wish it was in my early thirties and then I we ended that because I moved to Ireland so  yeah I'm in depending on the therapist and sitting on your intention like I I don't go into therapy thinking I'm going to be in this therapeutic relationship for the next 10 years I think that's ridiculous  I think you going to therapy to work on a specific problem and I have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board you can see things that you can't see and  we not work through that situation and come up with  a strategy for notches that not just in creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies and tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever  tell me about the last time you got  can I feel really happy  Zoe Sierra go  no that's not true it was when I  saw my biological mother which was last May  my best qualities  I'm very strong  very strong-willed  I  very supportive and loving and nurturing I'm easy to be around I'm intelligence  and  is there anything you regret  I don't think so  now  what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  don't take life too seriously  how ideal weekend, spend some time at the beach and spend some time with friends  either going out at night you know to a movie or just going out to  a club or bar somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together maybe go dancing after and Sundays I usually go to  and then I have brunch with friends and  may I go home and Sunday night and get ready for the next day so  I am most proud of  a few things that mean I've moved to places that I wanted to move to and so I've done things that have really spoken to me and if meant something been dear to my heart to actually  achieve those those  goals are those  yeah I've done things that I wanted to do like move to Ireland and move to California  okay"

like going to places such as mexico where it's gonna be sunny and just lying out i went to last year i went to arizona i never saw sedona that was really uh an experience pure peaceful about sedona yeah well sedona's a very energetic place and um i thought it was desert like flat kind of desert looking but it was it's very rocky and when you land in flagstaff there's these beautiful uh pine trees and it's the elevation is high and and coming into sedona was very beautiful and and after a day the pain in my back went away that i had there for months so and you had this even though we went to bed late and got up early you had this energy so it was really um very mystical in life <laughter> or in sedona in life um well being on stage in boston and um that was great i i loved doing that um um just being with friends and laughing are some of my highest moments when we're laughing hysterically well um i don't know of a particular situation but when i when i decorate for special events and um i worked with somebody on a regular basis and we would just find humor in everything and just laugh and and i i can't think of particular situation or what we were laughing at but just being with somebody who's in tune with my sense of humor and uh gets my jokes and you know i get his and we're just um enjoying that moment um speech and drama i i majored in uh no not now i always was interested in um musical comedy when i was a child i would sing along to records in my living room and i was always in choirs in school and then when i uh went to high school i joined the drama club and i i just always had an interest and i always had a a big personality and well <laughter> um i don't know if i have a dream job anymore i'm sixty and i don't know if i have aspirations anymore towards towards doing anything right now i'd just rather not work <laughter> and just um relax and travel but um i i like being creative in in any way i can i like independence and i kind of have that right now so i'm okay um well i i watch my favorite television shows that i've recorded and i also am a buddhist i've been a buddhist for um gosh since nineteen eighty eight and um i'm a district leader in my community and we have meetings and that really helps to center me and bring out my higher self so if i get tense or nervous i i chant um sometimes okay sometimes not a lot yes yes <laughter> less and less though it's been happening less and less but um yeah sometimes it's got it's it's um created difficulties well i can't <c> <sigh> i can't remember an argument i remember getting angry like was just when i was on my trip in vegas i was driving and the g_p_s said stay in the left lane and i stayed in the left lane but when i got off the freeway it brought me onto the ramp that went back onto the freeway about four miles out of our way and i just i got very angry for about thirty seconds and then i had to calm myself down and say okay alright so we're gonna be late you know i had to talk myself out of it so it wasn't really an argument with anybody but i felt kind of bad that i overreacted um you mean in my life <laughter> manys yes um gosh there's so many <laughter> i i just wish that when somebody tells me disappointing information like they're not gonna use me on a job or something that i would take an attitude that um i'll find something better it's okay and move on as opposed to feeling what's wrong with me and you know did i do something wrong and then get angry at them and you know that whole uh thought process that really doesn't help the situation and i do that more often but i since i started chanting but it doesn't you know i'm not always in my high life condition <laughter> where i can do that um i find a lot of situations <laughter> hard to make like you know what television to buy or something <laughter> but um um i guess <gue> i guess the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences and um um or leaving my  comfort zone <z> place if the decision meant that i have to leave my comfort place that would be a very difficult decision for me and probably leaving a relationship very hard because you <y> you know i get dependent on that relationship so i usually live it out til it's for you know it's they leave or something you know it's very hard for me to make that decision that this isn't right and i have to move on so what i usually do is i don't make the decision and i end up suffering but longer so mhm can we move on um well uh it's hard because um i don't know if it's because i have pain in my back and neck but i i it's difficult for me to stay asleep i'd i i i don't get a um a deep sleep um but at because of uh well i so okay it's hard to say because right now i i have this cold and i've had it for two weeks so i've been taking nyquil and that's been putting me to sleep so i have been um sleeping better because of it but last night i i woke up coughing so it's it's hard to tell but before that all happened i was um finding it difficult to stay asleep and so therefore i'm tired during the day and uh sometimes i'm groggy sometimes i'm irritable but yeah i'm not really sure if it's related to this pain in my back or emotional things or or or or not i'm sorry could you repeat that have i studied changes in my behavior uh no <laughter> i was not no mm mm oh i was happy last week <laughter> you know well i uh was going to um vegas to meet my family was my my family was flying in from cleveland to uh there we have a a relative in uh vegas and i drove with my friend and it was my brother in law's seventieth birthday so we all went and had a good time in vegas i mean i was struggling through my cold but but it was fun it was nice well <laughter> uh they think i'm funny um they feel that i say it like it is um they understand <under> they all say they understand me <laughter> so people who don't understand me i think sometimes don't know how to take me 'cause i'll i'll say something sometimes come out come across sarcastic but just <ju> that's just the way i talk so um my um the anger that sometimes wells up in me you know i just but although that that really made me i think a lot of the person that i am you know all all of your experiences make you who you are and how you handle them makes you who you are and if you don't have those lows you don't really know what highs are so i don't i can't really go back and regret you know i wish certain things didn't happen whatever but really what matters is today and now and how you handle today and i wish that well i can i don't wish i know that i will have less of these moments where i've just blurt out you know anger or something i just wish that would happen more less that the anger parts would happen less and they are so i guess it will <laughter> happen less um don't give up hope live in the moment and um everything will everything will work out everything will work out and if you believe that then you really have nothing to fear um the fact that now and for the past twenty years twenty some years i've been cultivating myself and i've become <be> i've become more um compassionate person and i'm able to um uh <ss> understand people better and see that you know their suffering <ss> they're suffering too and that if you if you treat people from that respect that they're they have their problems too and they're suffering with their problems too you're able to live a better life because you're not allowing that to affect you you're not taking it personally and at the same time you're becoming more compassionate person and when you're more compassionate you're you're happy and your life is happy okay
426,male,1,20,<sync. yes i'm alright south l_a um the weather the women the opportunities that's about it racism police brutality injustice that's it mm no not much of a exploring type of person um psychology mhm um it was one of the classes i excelled in the most so i decided to change it from business to psychology yeah yes no to own my own record label um it it's moderately hard but you know take it one day at a time just i guess you know stay focused a little bit of both um i tend to be shy in um situations i'm not comfortable with or i'm new to and i'm outgoing in places i'm more comfortable with yeah <laughter> um turn the lights down low and listen to soft music mhm i'm getting better over the years um i think i'm pretty decent now compared to how i used to be yes ma'am um due to the lack of i guess you could say controlling my emotions i have uh gotten incarcerated sent to prison yeah mm i'm not sure uh i don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision i've made in my life um it was probably a few days ago with the girl i was talking to and i was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness yeah uh frustrated because um you know uh you you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect you know the same effort by the other person when you're in a relationship and at the same time when you when you have expectations sometimes you kinda set yourself up for failure so you know i guess i'm just learning there's a lot of situations i would've handled differently um probably the most recent was uh i had gotten into a physical <phy> a physical altercation with an inmate when i was incarcerated and that made me that's what sent me to prison and and i had to do a lot more time and um if i handled it differently i probably would've never went to prison i probably would've been home a lot sooner than i originally happen yeah mm there are several events i wish i could erase from my memory um probably uh my first girlfriend um she did something really uh extreme it wasn't necessary in my eyes and it and it cost <co> it could've cost me my life i think that that that's a recurring thought that i i wish i could completely erase from my memory along with the good memories as well um a few you few fights uh i guess you could say shoot outs um getting jumped getting robbed you know those things i think those inhibit me i guess to to explore certain areas of life that i'm not comfortable with so those are the feww things that it'd be nice if i could erase it completely yeah <sigh> hurting people that didn't need to be hurt emotionally especially um a few women in my life or in my past um probably putting my mother through certain things that she didn't have to go through along with my close friends and family as well um used to be rocky growing up but as i got older and matured and the certain experiences that i've been through kind of brought me closer to my family so now it's it it's pretty decent it's it's pretty decent mm i would say my mother um yeah my mother um well she she uh she had her share of experiences negative and positive um i admire her the struggles she's been through um she she she uh experienced difficult economic hardships growing up but that didn't stop her um from raising a son at a young age finishing school getting her master's and just just overall being a a good person and she also battled mental health issues as well and um probably not the best of family that she could've been raised with so she so she's kinda of like a a inspiration to to me and other people as well so i would say my mother mm it's not easy so yeah it's not easy i couldn't tell you i i i've always had sleeping issues um i usually just take uh like over the counter sleep medication or nyquil but it makes you drowsy the next morning so it's like it's a negative effect really yeah the medication <medi> i don't know shit i don't know but i just stopped taking it 'cause i didn't like feeling drowsy not good at all um yeah i mean i recently got released from prison not too long ago uh i'm older now and a lot more responsibilities and i feel like my life is not where it's supposed to be i feel like i could've made a lot more better decisions in my life you know sometimes feeling sorry for myself and just things that i've been through and the whole nine yards so yeah it's all good yeah so true yes <sniffle> about two and a half three years ago <deep breath> <sigh> myself i um i was i was just tired of not i don't know i guess school kind of made me seek help because i started to understand myself how my brain works um you know so i decided to seek help maybe to better my life yeah you could say that yes i am yes yes i do actually i do mm better decision making um better tools to reflect on choices um how to control uh certain situations better yeah um <sniffle> well instead of just always reacting on emotion no matter what kind of emotion it is i step back and and and i assess the situation you know to see what's what's the best way to to react towards the situation and by doing that it has made me more mature emotionally more mature and just has a positive outcome <laughter> um i was lying next to a beautiful woman who who cared about me and the feeling was mutual so that was probably the most happy oh my goodness spontaneous um outgoing sometimes a little crazy um fun that's about it nothing um like i said earlier just you know hurting the the few women that were in my life my past and my friends and family that's about it oh shit uh school is really important um how i carry myself the people who i surround myself with and what i choose to do in my free time those are the few things i would tell myself good music um a good game of basketball um sex um i like going out i like going to parties um social gatherings where everyone's friendly and and there's no drama that's what i like dancing beautiful women a couple drinks that's about it um i guess not not necessarily giving up and and um just just i don't know just keep going just just not giving up really yeah mhm bye bye
347,male,1,16,yes alright uh new york state  um because of my girlfriend  about a few months ago mm it's okay it's a little different but it's working uh the weather's nice  uh nothing so far it's it's been pretty good  it's working out nice yeah it's real well at the moment uh real good i mean  uh criminal justice  uh i wanted to go to xxx and it was one of the courses so i decided to pick that one  no uh certified nurse's aide i don't know maybe nursing someday  no not too much  uh it gets expensive read usually  i don't know um  i usually don't get real real mad  pretty good a a lot better than when i was as as a child <laughter> oh i can't even remember it's it's been a very long time  i guess so  i don't know not really  reading's about it right now while i was waiting for my appointment  recently my girlfriend's been very positive  uh we met through my sister-in-law mm not so close anymore  no no i'm alright oh they just i i don't have anything in common with 'em so we don't talk  i don't know i really don't  um  i'm patient i listen and i try to be reliable  moved to california from new york that's that's been a a good experience  it was nice it was exciting  no it's fairly difficult  just i i wake up very easily and sometimes it takes a long time to get tired and fall asleep  not that i know of  just quiet try to stay to myself 'cause i get irritable  no no alright just anxious trying to find a job so  not really no just just <j> pretty pretty normal  my children  uh i've got four of 'em um three ten and then two eleven year olds so  yeah  that's that's hard just i don't know some of the things they do just yeah it it's a lot of fun watching 'em grow grow up  just the way they interact with each other sometimes it's or other people it's it's really amazing to see how fast they you know develop i don't know there's there's a lot that are tied for probably most memorable  no probably not  yeah it's pretty easy it's it it's a lot of fun  worrying about 'em you know you worry about 'em getting hurt  no not so much  probably go to college get you know try to find a a good a better job you know i feel happy all the time though i mean on and off so it's it's real hard to pinpoint 
440,female,1,19,<sync> yes i'm okay thank you um i was born in east los angeles and yes um the freedom to explore outdoors and with different um weather temperature <temp> you know with weather <clears throat> temperature and climates to go skiing or to the beach maybe in the same day i like that um mm i think probably the overcrowding um and the smog mm not not frequently but i have meeting other people and learning about their environment and their cultures sure um the last trip i've taken outside of here was to italy and um that was my second time being there and i enjoyed it more this time because um i knew what i wanted to see when i came back and um and i was better prepared for italians and their culture i felt i wasn't as uh you know i was just better prepared i thought for that trip um <clears throat> that would be um being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house in the midst of acres and acres and acres of grapes was just magnificent um human development um <clears throat> i actually didn't decide at first to do that i started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant and um i went to a program in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant and through the process i learned that um i had to do a long internship without pay and at the time <t> and i miss i had a family so i had to make a different <diff> a career choice quickly and um so the college offered human development as a major and i um just went right in and used my used <u> used my units that i had already acquired towards that particular major and and i'm happy with it um currently no i stay at home i have a little one uh well he's not so little i'm preparing to go back to work um in the meantime i design jewelry well i have three children um i have a almost four year old and then i have two older children seventeen and twenty three no um that your children the the love <sigh> from them and for them is unconditional all the stages that they go through they're stages all the time for every age <laughter> and then everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages so um i think i'm probably more in tune with those different stages that's why it makes me crazy um and i think that my parents the time that my parents were parents it was just kinda like you know is she fed is she dressed she has a house i mean a roof over her head and we're doing great as parents and we love her and so it wasn't um there wasn't too much i felt that that parents thought about in terms of that in terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there's books for every age every year month you know <clears throat> and um so i think it difference differs in that way tremendously very close <clears throat> outgoing mm i don't i don't um feel uninhibited <u> uninhibited i feel a little you know confident to talk to people i probably talk more than i need to <laughter> um <clears throat> i bead i <clears throat> do i design jewelry that's what i do to relax i'm pretty good i i well i think i um try not to not to um feel or let others know what my emotions are when i'm upset um which is not good 'cause if i don't do anything with them then i know that at some point it's gonna come out and um yeah that that's uh something i have to work on like exercising or something um <clears throat> it was my husband and it was about um he asked me whether i thought about cheating ever in our marriage on him uh really tired of talking about that same topic um well it came it spawned from <f> from a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for many things and um <clears throat> and so he took that information and came home and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me think about cheating and he knows that i've been resentful of him and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating <clears throat> and um <sigh> i we've had this conversation a lot of times and uh i mean not just that but i don't know just about cheating in general and um so i just said what i normally said normally say is that i haven't um cheated and that i did think about that when we were first together and uh but it was just a mere thought and um and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another and that just kinda <sigh> i guess irritated me i was really bothered by that and i just started thinking you know we're having this conversation yet again and why are we having this conversation <laughter> are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that that went into that um argument i mean it wasn't ayelling <y> yelling i mean it was part conversation and part texting um <sigh> not talking at all <laughter> um <sigh> mm pretty much any situation that involves my children and if i've yelled because i really don't like if i came to the point where i've had more of yelled it bothers me because um i was yelled at a lot and i just feel bad about that and i try really hard to not handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset i might get and result in in yelling hmm that would probably be whether to keep a pregnancy or not yeah yeah i um i was just talking about it yesterday actually and um oh i was pregnant and i had wanted i wasn't married yet and i had wanted to be married and but i just didn't think that i it was the right time for me and um i had pretty much made up my mind that i was not going to keep that pregnancy but i made the decision by myself and when my partner found uh discovered that i was pregnant he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me and so that decision was quite hard because i felt obligated to do so and felt super guilty to not and <drops microphone> oops and uh this is on correctly um hang on this ear piece is falling there we go that was probably the hardest decision actually you know what no i wouldn't say that's the hardest decision i ever had to make i'm sorry the hardest decision that i had to make in my life was whether or not <clears throat> um the hospital should um unplug the life or um life support machine for my father or not that was the hardest decision um because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that and to have been um to resort to the situation that he was in not capable of doing anything at all either speaking for himself um was beyond it who he was and i just couldn't see him like that anymore and he would be a vegetable i was told so i agreed to um resort that not hardly ever <laughter> too many things running on my mind um and pretty much um mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends uh even though i know that they're gonna come <co> i mean i'm constantly worried about uh how they are when they come home and so i really can't fall asleep on the weekends most of the time but um and you <y> sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting a good night's sleep i'm just exhausted <ex> exhausted i pass out but it's hard very stressed mm my son is is um has been uh in dealing with some legal issues and um currently is incarcerated and uh it's been really hard yes i've been probably very short moody irritable well i often think about a lot of things that aren't even happening <laughter> my mind just goes from one point a to point b and i don't even know how i got there um you know it's interesting uh yeah no yes about three years ago um my um o_b_g suggested i i uh see a psychiatrist yes well um i've in the process of changing therapists so it's been about because the program that i was in um lost funding and i lost my therapist or the therapist that i was working with and so it's been about two months maybe three now and um but i did notice when i was in therapy um that it was just an intricate part of my my life my week to see my therapist um it really helped me cope um <sigh> when i picked up my son <laughter> up from um when he was released from um jail um a go getter uh probably you know uh she would use the term hustler but meaning that i'll i'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to do what i need to do to support my family i mean you know legally of course um outgoing um maybe sometimes a little too for too outgoing for her um and compassionate sensitive loyal mm all the things that remind me of my mother <laughter> well yelling the yelling part was one um just <j> just the little things that used to drive me so crazy i see <s> can see myself doing them and it bothers me a lot regarding what mm <clears throat> um not too much really i don't know <clears throat> to go to college right after high school and not wait um and <sigh> that i didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy or that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and not in a relationship and still be happy and live life um what did i do mm i visited my son yesterday and that was really good yeah i was happy that he was safe um my children and uh my accomplishments in um school and work bye
486,female,0,4,already  okay great  yes  I'm feel great  I am from St Louis Missouri born and raised yes  I've been here a couple times I just recently moved back 2 months ago  St Louis is quite slower  I take care of a good friend is who who's ill  thank you  I jumped right back on the bandwagon  things you really like it  the climates  the restaurants  the dirt and the traffic  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes  yes I do  the road maps following a road map may be driving myself  but we just recently got back from Colorado  what happened to the mountains so that the snow and enjoy the little fine dining  in Colorado  I actually going horseback riding through the Royal Gorge  yes it was  I would be more outgoing  I'm a people person  I listen to jazz music and I also draw  I've probably mastered controlling my temper through age  it would have been my husband and it was about financial issues  and ensure unstable I don't like loud talking or loud emotion I like to sit in methodically and logically talk about things not raise my voice  most recently with the illness of my friend I wish I would have handled his sister a little differently as far as things that she's wanted me to do that I really needed to tell her  otherwise  the way they really needed to be done I took her advice where I shouldn't have  how do you know that  we I was engaged to him 15 years ago and he recently called me I guess about five years ago and told me he was diagnosed with cancer we've always maintained our friendship and I asked my husband if I could go help him in this time of need and I'm here  it has been  a lot of things one he's a good friend of mine and his sister moved out here as well to my son wanted to start his career out here 3 I love the weather  and that's all I can think of at the moment  I would be the the death of my youngest son  can you tell me about that I don't know where to start as far as he was born premature and since he was born so early I had him in 5 months versus 9 the we we made the decision to take him off life support cuz he wasn't getting any better so that would have been the the hardest decision I made with my husband  I really don't want to erase anything from my memory  I've actually learn and experience and gain knowledge from from things that happen so I'm not I'm not one to put things erase things out of my mind I categorize them  and play some in memories  that's very close lost my mother at a young age and Ava siblings and my father still remain very close  my father  always very health-conscious very energetic and exercises and has a spirituality about him that I want to have as well the contentment that he that he portrays that I that I would like to have as well  how is your day  no problem  very confused or skittish I guess would be the word  lately fine except for the fact that my good friend who I'm helping take care of we just got out of the hospital so it's been a little hectic the last 2 days  no not lately  have you ever been tagged  no I have not  no I have not  I was excited  with good friends and good company I should say and  I just got back from a concert so it was outside it was enjoyable music I was with good friends we ate well and enjoy the moment  as a  giving  spiritual  normal person I don't know  I can't think of anything that would want to change except for maybe exercise a little more  I  I can't recall one offhand  no  to have save more money  + 2  not trying to accomplish everything at once  I started out in cosmetology  then I went into college have some college in mathematics and finance  traveling  I like to enjoy good food nice Wine & Company I just went last night to very nice Italian restaurant was in the company of good friends and family and we dined and talked and that was fun  most proud of I guess it would be my children  thanks for sharing  you're welcome  bye-bye
477,female,0,2,okay sounds good thanks yes thanks  I am well thank you how are you  I grew up in Oklahoma  I moved La about five and a half years ago so I used to be on the wet on the east coast and then I decided I wanted to come out here  my hometown not very often most of my families moved away so I visit them but I don't actually get back to Oklahoma March  Oklahoma's very different Ellie is a lot more exciting there's a lot more to do here and the ocean obviously is very nice  you know that's a good question I I wanted to try something new and I've always loved the beach and I thought I also like big cities so I thought La might be a good place for me to come  very it's probably one of the best decisions I ever made  Kizi I think it seems kind of natural that seems like a good fit I just really like it here  that's great I have a couple of roommates and we get along really well I live a couple of blocks from the beach and every day I get to walk on the beach or you know hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice  I studied philosophy and political theory in government and did a little bit of English literature on the side  it kind of just happened naturally I think I went to a liberal arts school and got kind of exposure to a lot of different areas and I just followed what I liked was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that  not exactly I work for an educational non-profit so I work with grad with graduate students in the social sciences and Humanities but I don't actually use my philosophy background very often  you know I haven't actually study to become a success coach and so I working with students has is kind of a nice aspect of of doing that but I'd really like to work with with other people so I'm not just students but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams  hey it it's fairly hard I'm in the sense that  you know it can be challenging for people to actually be motivated and do all the work that needs to be undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but it's also a challenge because making a living at it requires charging people money so I'm finding people who are willing to pay for that can be difficult to  I'm definitely on the Shire side I'm an introvert so  I'm pretty good in one-on-one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a couple of people I very much an observer so I tend to listen a lot and I'm not as engaged and I think that is something that goes it is noticed by others and it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted so I bet say and it's also challenge 10 not to be the person who introduces myself in a room full of strangers  pretty good I think but I do have a temper so I can get I can get upside from time to time  really it can be a challenge when I'm driving but other than that no  I'm not sure  it would have probably been a discussion over politics and it probably would have been a friendly argument probably with one of my liberal friends so but I actually can't remember the specific time  I meditate I do that almost every day I also walk at the beach I love the ocean and I really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful and I like to read and be alone just with my thoughts so that's nice  well let me think about that for a minute  having a hard time coming up with anything I mean I'm sure there are plenty of things just nothing comes to mind  okay I'm sorry  well this isn't exactly an event it's with the dream and it's not a particularly traumatic dreams as far as dreams go but I do have it sometimes probably more often than I like so I wouldn't be upset if it even if I didn't have it and it's just a version of a dream that I think a lot of people probably have but it's usually me in school somewhere at the end of the semester haven't gone to class taking the exams know I'm going to fail and you know really unhappy about it wishing why did my studying attend class the way I should have which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now I have the stream sometimes and it's kind of frustrating and I'm not exactly sure  why I mean I know why but I don't know what it applies to because it's not like I am worried consciously at least about failing things so  no I don't think so at least not not that I'm aware of  I feel guilty I have a brother and a sister in law and a nephew and they live on the east coast and I love my nephew he's 8 he's adorable and I when I used to live there when he was younger I spent a lot of time with them and since I've been in California and particularly in the last year I spent a lot less time visiting them so for example I saw them for week of Christmas and then I went back and I think beginning of May so it was you know for months between the the last time I'd seen them and that I felt bad about because we really enjoy each other's company and he you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when I leave and he asked when am I coming back so that some  that makes me feel bad sometimes  well I have a brother I'm very close to him he's younger and  he's like for four and a half years younger he's married I have a nephew my both my parents have passed away so it's just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we're not that close with them with most of them on my father's side there's one brother and he's married and has if you could drive to cousins on that side then on my mother's side there are  545 other kids most of them with several children of their own so I have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and so we stay in touch a little bit through Facebook and they're a couple that I talk to you on the phone and visit every now and then but you know we're not that close with our extended family so  say it well  I have a lot of friends I think that have been positive influences  when I came out to California and I started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place is very different from what I was used to it was a little bit challenging and she also work there so we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and we just established this really strong friendship and she's kind of I would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general and now she's moved to Vegas which is a little bit tough for me but we're going to Napa this weekend so that should be good but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when I came out here to really know anybody in a know since I'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends is really nice because we share a lot of same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know I think she kind of gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice  how is your day  I'm a sleeper so it's pretty easy sometimes my you know depending on how long I've been awake I can be without a little wound up and somehow got to take a little while to decompress but I usually meditate right before I go to bed and that's very helpful and I can sleep  I generally sleep in 90-minute Cycles so usually six or seven and a half hours but I can easily sleep 9 hours if I have the time and inclination I usually don't wake up in the middle of the night or at least if I do I don't remember it so  well I actually don't sleep very well when I travels one of the things I do for work is I travel quite a bit because I work for a company that's back East so I work from home most of the time but then I travel like one week a month and when I travel I'll take the red-eye and then I'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so I don't sleep that much it's not that I sleep poorly or badly it's just that I don't have that much time to sleep and the first day after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay usually the second day it's not very good sounds like a lot more tired and it's harder to concentrate and I don't know it just feels like more of a struggle  good summerisle is an is a busy time for the organization that I work for so I'm a little I don't know stressed is the right word but you know a little anxious about everything going well this summer but in general I'm feeling pretty good  really I can't I can't do anything there is one thing I am I do struggle with exercise like I like to walk a lot and I hike with friends and I have been really motivated about it for a couple of months but then I went away to the east coast when I came back I was a lot less motivated cuz I didn't really exercise when I was there and I gotten out of the Habit even though it only been about ten days and so now I'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as I would like  it's okay thank you  now  now  well  he's a lot of fun and he really likes me and I really like him and we play a lot of games and talked a lot and actually doing a book club now so we're going to Skype and may God is more time with him that way but just being around him is fun  well she probably say that I know how to have fun but that I can be serious  and  that I care about others and that I'm loyal and  I'm not sure what else  I think those those are probably the main things  I wish I had more self-discipline so I wish that you know I could die it or eat healthier foods and not have a problem with sugar because I love to eat sugar I wish that I would not procrastinate because I've gotten a lot better about that but I still do and I can be challenging and I wish that I  I don't know  I wish that I was in a relationship so  probably those things  so the last organization I used to work at I had a boss and she was I don't feel like she was  I don't think we were very compatible and she used to push my buttons or so I thought and so  a one day she was really upset about something because a board member had called her up and asked her a question if she didn't have the answer and he was upset about something and it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was but it wasn't I I've been a manager for many years and I have very strong opinions about how you handle challenges with with staff members and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate I thought I meant she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel incompetent or at least that's the way that I felt about it and  I did you know I tried to be very calm and said that I would take care of it and I did take care of it but after that our relationship wasn't really the same and I ended up leaving there to go back to the old organization that I work for not that long afterwards because I just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me or after we had that interactions  so I heard this piece of advice the other day and or this thing and then I thought it's really profound and I wish that I had read it back then which is when you think about buying something instead of thinking oh here's this beautiful coat it's $100 I want it I'm going to buy it I don't think of it is costing $100 think of it is costing 10 times that because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it you know intelligently you would have 10 times that much money eventually so you should really think about it in those terms and I think I've been much more consumer than a saber and so I wish that I had to been more aware of that 10 or 20 years ago  probably  they asked me to be his god parent and his Guardian if anything should happen to them and that meant a lot to me because of it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that I was a good person the kind of person that could take care of their child should something happen to them so  let's see  well it wasn't really recently but in February I went I like to travel and a friend and I went to Singapore and I got to fly first class is miles of frequent flyer miles to get the tickets and so that was really enjoyable because the seats fold down to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and I also hadn't been to Singapore before so that was kind of cool to  sure thank you bye  hey
367,male,1,19,are there any parameters aren't I mean is should I just talk naturally or just went wherever I'm comfortable okay I get there  one last thing  let you know when she's done I'm going to hand you the  okay  and please  are you okay with this  yes  how are you doing  I'm okay I'm a little  pensive I guess a little down but more or less okay  I was born in Annapolis Maryland on the East Coast  originally I moved because I went to film school and but then I decided to come move back to Washington DC to do some work and now I'm back here again  it's very different being from the East Coast it just has a different feel to it but living  La is very as a very different kind of attitude I guess and so it's a little difficult but I but I've gotten more used to it since I've been here  not at all when I left things got things are sort of I lost my job out there and so I had to move out here kind of quick to to be with  some people who are going to help me out and I'm just I don't know if it's strange just the right word but I'm kind of not really speaking to my family are old friends that off  it's not easy it's  it's kind of  I miss I miss a lot of people I miss my old life before I lost my job I miss some friends I miss a lot of the relationships that I had out there so it's difficult I mean it weighs on my mind a lot I feel like I failed and now I'm here and I can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard  you consider yourself more shy or outgoing  depends on the situation I think I'm out going when I'm comfortable and then I'm extremely outgoing but when I'm in a situation I'm not comfortable with this I tend to be a lot more shy so that doesn't really answer your question but  I have certain  I do I do a lot of writing I have certain music that I listen to as I'm writing and when I can when I can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world the music and the the thoughts just kind of happening really it can it soothed me it's like it's when I feel most relaxed I guess  when is the last time that happened  a few weeks ago I guess I was I've been working on a on a on a book on a novel and when I was really what I was really getting into writing it and  it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good I felt like I was accomplishing something and I was felt really relaxed  what was it about  it was about  guy who's searching for something it's  it's it's his last day on Earth and so he's going to find a person that he that he met and just  I was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes he has on Earth with her just because  certified it's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing  what made you decide to do that  well I've always I've always been a writer part of the reason I came to La was because of screenwriting so I wrote some screenplays and you know had a little bit of success with that out here and but since since that I kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and I've started to write more short stories and and longer just creative writing so I've been meaning to write a novel by just waiting for the idea that to really hit me  how hard is that  it's not easy the the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle I find it difficult I have a real love hate relationship with writing when I when I love it I just absolutely love it but sometimes I hate it because it's so difficult but it's worth it for the times when it when it's good  how are you at controlling your temper  good I don't I don't really have a temper it's not I mean most of my anger that I have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people if something is really really stressful if I'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation I can lose it but I've put probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life I mean generally I pretty much try to it when I'm upset I get upset with myself not with other people  when was the last time you argue with someone  last night I guess I got in an argument about whether or not  cleaning vegetables was necessary because of I forget but it well know it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because I'd already started cutting the vegetables and I thought that would be okay so it turned into this big argument and we did Google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and I I ended up being wrong on that one but it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow-up argument but it was a definite argument  okay  what's something you feel guilty about  lot so much  I was in a relationship that I really really better really wanted to work and  I ended up and it was partly due to I hadn't I was on that I wasn't on the right medication and so I was going like everything that sort of spiraled out of control and I feel really guilty about the way that that ended I mean I wasn't I wasn't mean but I was but I was getting more and more messed up and I couldn't stop it and it ended and so I feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not  and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again so  that was pretty that was pretty tough  you've done anything to avoid it  what some of it was was that  I wasn't medicated properly I mean now I've been to a doctor and I'm on medication that's  completely kind of I mean I still get I still get upset and I still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not I don't completely lose it for days at a time so I mean I know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if I had if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then I would have then it would have probably been different if I was who I am now then I would have I would I would be  I would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but I mean I could have  I don't know I don't know if I could have done anything different  things being how they were  I mean it's  it's possible I mean obviously  yeah because I mean that's what I do I I  take little I mean I take little things and I just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy I dwell on stuff and it's like any little detail that comes up I suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day I mean I still I still get I still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed and I feel ashamed about stuff that I did in high school which was years and years ago I which I shouldn't even be thinking about anymore cuz it's so in the past but I still get that feeling like I'm right back there  that sounds really hard  well it's not easy I've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it I mean I dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to slow my mind down that way but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better  well like I said I do a lot of you know if I'm if I'm writing or if I'm doing anything like I kind of have to almost  you doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely if I'm watching TV I have to be playing a game on my phone if I'm using the computer I have to be you know watching a TV show or a movie on you know on it in another window so that I can just keep my mind occupied during all that  I just need I mean I I wish that I could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but I just I can't yet  I need triggered by something  they're triggered by everything pretty much anything that I said I see if I if I if I hear somebody with a Dutch last name if I if I hear somebody talk about Wisconsin if I hear you know she will talk about  anyting you know I can reach back and connect to  to this it's really it's really  I don't know that's the thing I mean I don't ever get a break  from it  now  how easy is it for  I'm a very light sleeper so I'm awake and asleep and awake and is I have no problem going back to sleep but I generally you know don't  I don't know I'd never really needed much sleep so it's just only recently that I've really started to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep like I would I would usually stay up until 2 or 3 in the morning so that I could just be so exhausted that I would just calling out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work but now it's it's it's like if I do that I can't I still don't get enough sleep I don't clock out I still just sleep very lightly you know I get up I toss and turn all night you know and now  it's just it's  yeah I don't sleep too great right now  pretty I mean I don't know it's hard to it's hard to know I usually just kind of power through it and just I'm at I'm like how I am now I just I just feel bad  okay  how long ago were you diagnosed  I think  334 years ago  it was when I  I had been given taking stuff for anxiety for 4  years before that but then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you actually got this situation and we need to get you the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so  so yeah that was that was kind of a turning point but unfortunately it happened after everything went bad so  at the moment I don't know I don't really think I thought about it too much then but looking back on it I feel  it really makes me angry it really makes me you know given where I am right now it makes me really angry that I'm  that I had that I I lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain because of things that I couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me I mean I was paying I was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing it you know it wasn't  it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know I managed to find somebody who did work and I just yeah so I'm I'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now  there really wasn't any choice I had to I was I was a mess I was it was either  I was I was self-medicating it was affecting my work I mean it was everything was just there was a point where I really realized that I mean I just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and and all this stuff you know they just decided that I was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off  but it was at least that and not  firing me but but but yeah but so I got help but it was  but it wasn't soon enough  not not as much as I should  I go to a couple of meetings I go to I go to AA so that I can you know keep control of that aspect to 2 and there's a there's a therapy aspect that unfortunately you know being unemployed my unemployment ran out you know I'm time you know what I'm getting my medication from the city of La so you know I'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody so I have a psychiatrist that I go see but it's really  very I've only seen her three times in the past year so basically to keep my medication coming  then there's you  right  changes have you noticed  well like I said I mean  this the top I mean let's just take the AAA for example because that's probably the close closest for that I'm seeing with therapy right now just saying stuff out loud is just like getting getting the stuff out trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense  that you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a a therapist or just a room full of of drugs you know I mean you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something that you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing  you know better than I that I have been I mean  it is sort of a good it has its ups and downs you know I'm applying for jobs 5-6 jobs or more a day you know I never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to 2 to being self-sufficient again it's hard but that's like real world problems I feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control so now it's just I have to deal with real life witches  Jazz at the juices don't own challenge  it was probably you know a couple of years ago  I was I mean the thing that immediately comes to mind is everything was going well at my job I was making these great videos with this person that I ate that I was having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a Christmas tree  and we spent it all this time picking out the perfect Christmas tree and it was just  feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger  the bigger life  that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel  you know for that instant I felt like  a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and  I mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant I felt like a normal person a normal happy person and  part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that  I don't know if I'll ever feel that again  so  what are you most proud of in your life  probably the  probably this educate educational series I did educational video series I did for the National Science Foundation  it was it was really hard and it would but in the end it turned out really good and you know I'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about  in about the world around them so that I feel like that was a real contribution that I made to the world  I was part of you know it's part of my my job it was it was a we were trying to come up with with new ideas for because we were put together videos and stuff to give you know to two schools and everything and they had done this before but we decided to do something really big you know when there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of  and there was a lot to it and so it was probably the biggest  project that the NSF has decided to do and so we just kind of produced it  I guess  I don't know I don't know it's been awhile it's been awhile since I've since I've really thought about that I don't know what I'd go somewhere would I  I don't know  thank you  Audi

from my with back and it uh is a little depressing you know i get depressed also um you know just thinking about my business that i sold and you know where i would've been if i hadn't have done that and a a general feeling of um i've been a little depressed over the past uh couple of years actually yes um well i've been diagnosed many many years ago and i guess depression stays with you although it gets treated um and uh i was diagnosed about two years ago uh i think i don't know it asked me that on the questionnaire as well and uh and i sought treatment for it and then uh my insurance ran out and the prescriptions uh i couldn't put uh do my prescriptions anymore but now i'm back on uh medication <med> medication and you know so i take medication for my depression therapy absolutely i love therapy wow that's huge um confidence in self uh confidence in myself um confidence in my decision-making a general feeling of overall content uh a sounding board you know when i have stuff that's bothering me that i can't go to the i i feel that i can't go to the person with i um can go to my therapist and a lot of times the issue is resolved there it wasn't a big issue or i worked through it or the therapist through the therapist allowed me to look at a different way of looking at the situation and in that way i find therapy to be invaluable actually i believe so uh yes i was i believe it was i think it was told to me by a psychiatrist that that's what i was that's what i was having and this was within the last five years i think it was looking back now what are we two thousand thirteen it was two thousand nine so four years ago not able to deal like shell shocked not able to deal with anything eh irritable on the phone uh i mean just uh just anything would get me to fly off the handle and um just uh not able just shell shocked and not and hiding at my in my house not opening mail <m> mail not being able to concentrate not being able to deal with with things that were that i felt were well that were bombarding me i felt overcomed <o> overcomed and um the psychiatrist said that it was post-traumatic stress disorder but um and i was given some medication which i stayed on for a year or so uh or so and i don't know through psychiatry and therapist and medication um i was able to come out of my shell a little bit hmm about a week ago i was on a hike eh up in malibu and uh at this beautiful labyrinth that looked over the pacific ocean and we i was with a friend and we were having lunch and i laid down on the grass and took a nap and i felt content i was happy at that moment at that moment that time about a week ago hmm honest sincere smart um caring um <sniffle> smart um <sigh> good question i'd have to think about that uh yeah i have regrets in life you know everything works out so um you know if i could change the past i would've never dropped out of school when i did a long time ago i mean i've since gone back and completed lots of stuff um i probably would've gone into the military i think i was going to do that in my early twenties i'm fifty five now um i sort of regret not doing that um at that time um i regret uh selling my business i regret and of course i can't control this but i regret that my father died when i was so young and he never really got to know me and i never really got to know him i regret uh i regret not seeing my grandmother enough before she'd passed away i regret uh i mean those are the things that i can think of right now not putting away for retirement i regret when i had the money to do it um yeah i mean just here that's what i would say stick with it just stick with it because in order to get out you have to go through and i it when it comes to fear or flight i get the fear and i flight so sometimes you just have to sit in fear and then everything works out wow i'm most proud that i <sigh> have remained genuine um i'm most proud of being who i am and being basically comfortable with that and i'm proud of that i haven't changed to the world <wor> to the world you know for the world i haven't changed i've stayed mm who i am thank you thank you bye

i'm on vacation but i feel more at peace over there than here well my uh family moved down here for a better life uh that was my parents mm just the weather and the different things that you could do you could be at the beach or you could go to the mountains different variety of things to do the traffic and sometimes <somet> yeah basically the traffic and yeah that's one of the main things not that much i been to new york and uh mexico only uh just uh seeing new places and finding new locations you know something new like for a trip or well i've been to uh in mexico i've been to the pyramids of uh i forgot what's it called in mexico city and i like you know about uh finding about my ancient culture since i'm uh uh mexican from mayan aztec so i like to see different things like that well uh at school well i did uh drop out but i came back and i'm trying to get back into it right now trying to learn uh graphic designs well i started liking you know to take pictures doing different things and i like you know uh going into business i like what the it entitles about i wanna have my own business either making web pages just be able to be free and don't being relying on someone else just be able to have freedom for myself outgoing well i just like to you know be around people like to get to know people and depending on the person how i feel around 'em i like to hear music or you know do do different things like play sports or do different things just to unwind well i'm getting better at it you know i xxx well it was like uh two days ago it was something about uh i needed to pay a bill or something <some> something that uh i you know i had taken care of but the person he's like more picky about it you know he's more you know how how girls are you know they they want everything right there and then i have it handled you know i have it everything there and they just bugging sometimes they don't give you the space that you need to resolve something well i felt like i was overwhelmed i already had it resolved i just was waiting for a check you know that's not on my control but i already had made the paper proper arrangements and she's bugging me about it and it's like you're making you know an argument you know a storm in a glass of water it's like mhm well uh differently there's couple of them but not so recently because i've been more trying to get my life together but the decisions i made before in the past like dropping out of school and doing other different things mm guilty not that much because not really not that i could think right off the top of my head the hardest decision oh it's just not on top of my head right now an event mm well the only things that i remember is when i black out or different things like that that i don't remember but not nothing like a particular only when my uh brothers died and different things like that mhm well my brother was in gangs and different things and he was getting more into trouble and it's just not a pleasant memory for me to talk about that much get into it no i'm hispanic i you know i like to be with my family and you know i i like to go over there to mexico too i have a half-sister and my grandpa died he was over there in mexico so i do uh like to have a good relationship with my family well my mom and dad they always work hard they always done what they had to do to pay the bills that's why sometimes i be like you know running around trying to get everythings done but done correctly not trying to take the easy way out it's a little hard because there eh especially here in los angeles there's a lotta different things that you could get into that's not that positive and it's hard to stay focused on you know the correct stuff well normally i just knock out it's not that hard it's like it takes me like half an hour or fifteen minutes but uh sometimes i can't even wake up even with the alarm uh they have to wake me up you know my girl has to wake me up even with the alarm going on it's like so hard so you know i just knock out i do get a little either i'm angry or i don't feel good and i'm not filled with energy but i still have to know i know i have to do something so i still go through with it i been well i been uh feeling good you know been a little restless but not that much i had to do stuff so i just you know put myself to do it no matter how i feel no nothing out of the ordinary no no the last time i felt happy that was probably on the weekend that i was you know going out with a going out have some fun and you know i was drinking and just relaxing and winding <win> winding down mhm my ideal weekend is usually with my girl either out or at home just relax but nothing else you know just be able to relax and unwind with her you know either going out somewhere to a nice place or staying at home but without getting any calls or xxx interruptions you know just be able to turn off the phone and turn off everything just be with her doing the other different things mhm uh like an outgoing guy you know very social but at the same time i'm reserved depending how i feel with people have to you know build trust or feel comfortable with them oh i'm changing a lot you know like uh my temper and different things drinking things i'm changing a little different things so i could get more different things done oh there's several but mostly uh is when i'm coming from mexico that they wanna demeander you even down there it feels uh like silly because i went to a store i was regularly dressed and i was telling 'em i wanted to buy something and then they said that that i i wasn't belong there and i and as soon as they saw my credit card they kinda changed perspective because they saw the wells fargo logo they know i was american but they thought it was like you know it it was <wa> it felt me it felt ridiculous to me because you go to a place and you have the money you ask for something you're gonna ask for something because you have it not just to waste <wa> kill their time just because they saw a logo of a card that's how they you know it just it was ridiculous for me no basically uh to stay more focused on different things uh stay in school and you know don't go you know try to control my temper and do different things because if i knew what i know now back then it'd be different well uh i did drop out but i did uh go back to school and i you know i did get my high school and right now i'm in the process of doing other different things so right now is uh getting my high school getting that together and right now i'm working to another goal trying to get you know my either going back to school so it's basically <ba> basically getting back to school and finishing the high school the g_e_d mhm okay you're welcome bye
330,male,1,12,<laughter> yes i'm okay with this very good l_a it's sunny and uh it's near the ocean <sigh> uh the traffic can make it difficult to drive around between different places and there's a lack of uh uh open uh spaces if you're not near a beach uh no um i uh i haven't planned on haven't finalized any travel plans listen to music yeah um uh well i tend to excel at things that  have to do with um uh spending time alone versus things that have to do with uh spending time outside with uh lots of people i'm reasonable mm maybe maybe yesterday i was trying to figure out how to stuff <stu> pack something into the car i'm very good at it <deep breath> i breathe in and out <sigh> like that <sigh> uh like jogging walking bicycling reading <sigh> listening to music uh math engineering computers uh a little bit yeah um i'm a student i'm going back to school for uh biological sciences um <sigh> started doing some reading on um some textbooks dream job um <sigh>  medical doctor uh it's i guess it depends on the type of medicine you practice <laughter> uh i have a mentor yeah i have a mentor who has a lot of positive um thoughts and um suggestions i uh through a professional so i met someone through a class and then they worked with them professionally so it's i guess you could say through an academic or professional channel <sigh> hmm mm <sigh> uh let's see one of my most memorable i can't think of one at the moment no no i don't think so no <sigh> takes me a little while to fall asleep but once i'm asleep it's it's reasonably okay uh i think i'm a little forgetful and nervous no sometimes mm what do you wanna know mm <sigh> well um i think sometimes i do think about  challenges ahead of me and uh that can be a little daunting and i i feel down it is very hard go for a walk read a book listen to some music um <sigh> i don't i mean i'm sure they are i'm not specifically sure what triggers anything uh maybe feeling overwhelmed or uh not feeling particularly tied to some task i don't go to a therapist um reasonably smart inquisitive <inqui> inquisitive and curious mm i guess through classes uh <sigh> somewhat mm patience and curiosity uh <sigh> enjoyed hmm mm think i went on a walk at night uh a day ago no can you repeat that can you rephrase that uh i think they're lucky very lucky got everything in front of 'em yeah uh <sigh> most proud of <deep breath> <sigh> maybe academic achievements uh i guess just the time i've spent studying math and science um hmm mm mm i'm not sure
400,male,0,7,"all right  thank you  are you okay with this  yeah  I'm fine  Pacific Grove California  the wholesale opportunities and all the stores and anything I could ever ask for  the traffic is the mood of the people and the unhealthy pace  I would see I did like culinary and I did really good in art and music  in high school  through my own will and desire to want to get involved with the music  no  open up a health practice of some sort  what made you decide to do that  changing things in my life that had an impact on myself and others for the for the benefit of Health  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes  do you travel  when I have the opportunity  buying things seeing the culture relaxing not thinking about the city  well yeah I used to go to Texas every every year with my dad during the summer and I always wanted to stay there and live there when I went on vacation  most likely one of these trips to Texas where we would go and spend time in the desert shoot guns and ride go-karts and stuff like that  it was  I'll see y  my dad and I are not really talking that much and my mom Dust Away about 2 months ago  I'm sorry to hear that  thanks  definitely Marsh I always been that way  I just a personality that I've grown into but learning how to adjust the sensitivity and grow out of it  sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got  teen  eating I like to eat that make that calms me down  not that good when I get really upset that it's usually a problem and I have to work to come myself down and sometimes I just don't get on something and I don't stop  sometimes but I've learned to control it to that extent now  when was the last time you  yesterday I was arguing about what's what kind of water we should be drinking  oh well a difference of opinion and I felt as though my opinion was very valid even though the other party's opinion was somewhat misinformed  definitely everyday is growing process I wish I would have handled everything differently every day which is what makes me grow and I tried to work toward, it would have wanted to handle things everyday little by little  okay  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to  can't think of anyone right now  what's something you feel guilty about  find I'd I'd say not supporting my friends as much with their career choices  I'd rather not get into it  the raw food Educators on YouTube and raw vegan Educators and the detox therapy therapy experts have been really inspirational in the past 2 months  well that they believed that the essence of all nutrition comes from the raw fruits and vegetables and this is true with many studies like T Colin Campbell The China Study the sources of information that are that are very good and I think deserve respect based on you know real research  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep really easy I've almost got it down to a science  what are you like when you don't say  I'm tired  I'm feeling better than I have in a long time  oh yeah I think it's due to the transition in the diet and in no way having a placebo effect that's actually you know losing them talks and some things that I've accumulated over my short lifetime of you know toxic choices with Food and Drugs or whatever it would be  yes I'm less tense and less irritable and I have more clarity and more control over my  decisions in my wants versus what I need that sort of thing  nope  yes to some extent  our 5 years ago  lack of motivation and  basically make my symptoms were paralleling that of depression  loss of appetite loss of motivation not wanting to do anything not wanting to be social at all having fear of social situations and the main for 5  no  I believe I overcome to chapter in my life that was the the doctor you know taking control my health and experimenting with drugs and I just sort of took another route which was alternative and I started juicing more and just trying to listen to maybe what I needed with help of the internet and nutrition experts and stuff like that  yes  can you tell me if  I believe therapy is useful because  without looking inward or having somebody to help you to that it's very hard to readjust to some of these problems that you can have that will just resume in the subconscious and tell you you know it has an outburst is basically therapy will help an overall health and mental health I believe fairy  last night I made a really great vegan dinner with no meat tacos and cheese and guacamole and had a couple of my friends over and they really liked it a lot of almost converted them  I would say  you know I'm trying to listen to my inner conscious more than what my brain wants me to do like my brain likes caffeine and sugar or as you know my body needs something other than that  apple  it's very very hard it's a daily process  tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad  I was handling money for a business partner and they ended up short and I was to blame but it was actually my formula crunching the numbers that it made it short but they he was unaware of the change I make the formula so the blame is on me that I may have took money and I automatically felt bad about that because of my uneasy my uncertainty to the change of formula  is there anything you regret  no  20 years ago I was two years old 10 years ago is 12 years old I would tell myself to  to start eating raw fruits and vegetables everyday  as calm and  sad maybe smart talented  I really enjoyed going to the Wholesale Food Market in downtown Los Angeles  can you tell me about that  lots of food at great prices you can eat and feed a whole family for a third of the price is going to a normal supermarket  so I really get a lot of enjoyment of teaching people how to maybe better themselves especially food-wise what they're eating  what are some things that usually put  eating and I'm watching a really good TV show  okay  I'm insightful I cannot I can adjust to people  I don't know I guess I'll skip that question for now  I'm most proud of  that's in my overall situation with where I'm at right now I could have never imagined that I'd be in such a fortunate situation  that's so good to hear  because I want everything I need  sharing your thoughts with me  I think she's done"
444,female,0,7,<sync> yes i'm fine i'm doing very well today i feel good today uh born in indiana mhm grew up in bloomington i moved to l_a for a job working with the c_d_c i've only been back twice

the woods when i was a a kid we'd swim in the quarries um i rode my bicycle everywhere and here it's a little um more uh cement and traffic um it was <wa> it just seemed like cement at first but i love it now and i have friends and i i love being able to do so many different things um and i go to the beach a lot um i still go up to the mountains i go camping all the time um so i i love it i love it always opportunities <laughter> um i have traveled quite a bit i was in the peace corps and i was um <tisk> in south america i was in paraguay for three years and i traveled all through south america brazil peru uh peru chile bolivia um i also spent a year in london traveled all through europe and i used to go to canada often uh i'd love to get to asia one of these days uh meeting new people the food i love trying new food um and just getting a different perspective on the world and different people's um outlook on the world and because america tends to become isolated um i hiked the inca trail when i was in um uh peru and that was a five day hike starting out of cusco um we hiked for um i think what four or five days um and woke up one the last morning at the sun gate of machu picchu and that was just an most amazing experience 'cause i would only i'd i'd seen about i'd seen it in national geographic you know all my life um so to be there and experience that was phenomenal philosophy i have my degree in philosophy i minored in art <clears throat> well i started out in business and i got very disenchanted with it very quickly and so i decided to study what i wanted to study while i was in college and had the opportunity so that's what i wanted to do and everyone advised me against it because you can't get a job as a philosopher um but i had the idea of getting my philosophy degree then going to law school and being a professor of ethics um but that kind of fell apart and that's actually how i ended up joining the peace corps <laughter> so it all worked out i'm sorry yeah mhm i'm i'm sorry my alarm's going off on my phone it'll die in a second okay i'm sorry it's still going sorry i turned off the phone but i forgot to turn off the alarm that should go okay what i'm sorry what was your question my dream job um <sigh > gosh um writing um i've done a few um uh scripts uh some screeenplays with a friend of mine um but i don't really wanna do the hollywood thing um <tisk> but writing and teaching and traveling if i could do that overseas so outgoing should i turn off my alarm <laughter> it keeps going <laughter> here oh i can't move okay i can't get to my purse okay i'm sorry yes i i turned off my phone but i didn't turn off the the alarm is like <laughter> it's like i forgot it's my alarm to go to yoga class i'm terribly sorry about that <laughter> okay <laughter> <laughter> sorry for the interruption um i have a actual fish tank um at my house and i i do the the same thing and i do that with my children when they get upset um the i sit them in front of the fish tank and it's very relaxing um i also try and meditate um i try and and just sit down and be quiet um and gather my thoughts um i like to read and um or sometimes i i walk or i'll take my dog for a walk <sigh> i wish i could say i was good at it but usually i um i tend to have outbursts every once in a while um when things are getting too chaotic at my house um and i'm feeling very underappreciated i will have a burst of anger yeah my husband doesn't appreciate that um and i i i've never done it at work or in a social situation but at home with my family i've done it and then instead of um recognizing that i'm upset about it my husband tends to get mad at me for being mad and then that escalates and uh sometimes i just end up walking out the door or going to my room hmm i'm sorry um i i usually after i have an outburst and i isolate myself for a little bit i can come back relaxed and deal with the situation in a more calm manner um sometimes it's very hard but i i i've gotten to the point where i know just to stop and and get myself out of there and and go take some deep breaths um and then really try and figure out what i'm feeling why i'm being angry why why am i being um so tense and then be able to verbalize that um well i i it happens a few times when i start getting i've had a very tense day um and things haven't gone right um i tend to have outbursts in the kitchen while i'm  making dinner and the kids are all home and they're asking me questions about their homework or they're turning on the t_v or and my husband's uh uh bothering me about things that i just don't need to think about right then and one time i just said okay everyone out of the kitchen leave me alone get out just let me finish dinner and nobody would and i just it just had more pressure building up and building up and i actually took one of the pots and just banged it against the stove <laughter> really hard to just like get people to pay attention to what i was saying it actually made a dent in my stove <laughter> um which is still there um so that that i i should have um walked out sooner and taken my deep breaths before i did that um it was probably when i was pregnant with my first child um i wasn't married um <tisk> i had a very good friend um oh i was i was thirty two at the time so i was uh you know i wasn't young i think if i was younger i probably would have decided to have an abortion but at that point in my life i'm like okay i'm i'm going to have this um and i had um i i got pregnant by the man i actually married and still married to um but we'd only been dating like three months and i was living with a a good friend of mine who i had been in the peace corps with um and she and so i didn't know this guy very well um i didn't know if we could raise a child together i didn't know if i wanted to get married and raise a child with somebody else um and my friend suggested that we raise the child together um even suggested moving to costa rica to raise the child together um and uh so it was a lot of um huge decisions that were gonna determine the rest of my life um and i made the decision based on more common sense and practicality um but i don't regret that decision i think i made a good decision to marry my husband and raise our child <laughter> um they're older now my uh my eldest is seventeen he is um <tisk> at da vinci science uh school and he's very much into engineering he is getting his pilot's license uh which i'm very proud of him for um then my daughter is fifteen and she loves acting uh she um she has a boyfriend who um uh they see just once a week at church basically um and they text each other constantly um she's a very very typical fifteen year old and then i have a twelve year old he is extremely active <laughter> and is in constant motion and is always making noises but i love him dearly um he is into rock climbing and there's a rock climbing gym near our house so he has a membership there so he goes over there and rock climbs almost on a daily basis no i find it extremely difficult i don't i wasn't my mother had a very difficult <d> my dad died when i was young and um my mother kind of disconnected when that happened um so i didn't have a very warm or loving relationship with my mother or growing up and i basically raised myself i was um kind of on my own from a very young age um i mean she was at the house but really had no interaction with her so i really didn't have parenting skills that you know most people are are raised with um i know what not to do but sometimes it's very difficult and um i i see my friends that have you know these very innate parenting skills these very warm and you know they're making cookies and everything's organic and they knit everything and you know their house is always perfect um and it's like i i'm just not that person so i i i try and be i'm i i think i am a very good mother but i'm not um a typical mother i think i'm more um i'm more creative a lot of times i and we do a lot of things um but it's not a warm fuzzy cozy kind of thing actually when we go camping it's more i'm more homey when i go camping than i am at home i think i'm more tense when i'm at home but i'm trying to like through meditation and things of that sort i'm trying to become calmer and more patient i think my patience is what um i need to work on the most i'm a been an insomniac all my life i remember as a child laying in my bed watching the stars go across the my bedroom window and um i haven't slept well for a long time um but i realize that if i exercise and i do something with my brain intellectually during the day i have to be physically tired and intellectually tired to sleep well um and that's sometimes that's hard to do um and so a lot of times i stay <s> i stay awake reading i'll read 'til midnight um and then i'll try and go to sleep um and usually i won't get back up even if i i'll wake up at three again and things of that sort but i'll try to go back to sleep yesterday i didn't feel so good i was um i think a lot of it has to depend on the weather  and it was all cloudy and grey yesterday um 'cause i planned on planned on working on my garden and then i'm i'm building <buil> i'm making a butterfly garden in my front yard um so i had some more planting to do and i just couldn't didn't kind of feel like doing it um so i just sort of puddled about and wasted a lot of time yesterday but  today i feel really good so i feel more positive i feel more energy so no no um i don't know i just got a new mattress actually that hasn't really helped me sleep but um it was really good because i needed one for a really long time and it i was just kind of excited about being delivered <deli> it delivered and and set up and and that sounds like sort of mundane um but it was you know just like i'm finally doing something positive 'cause it's it's something that i put off doing and put off doing and put off doing and it was like finally uh there and concrete and it's like okay i've done this task that i can check off my list um but also i took the kids camping over um spring break and uh we just had a fabulous time and we sat around telling stories and  um around the camp fire and making s'mores and things like that and those kind of times make me very happy <laughter> i don't know um i think she believes that i'm uh uh more intellectual and smarter than i think that i am at times so she comes to me with a lot of um issues uh she always she always solicits advice from me she thinks i give her good advice um and when she doesn't know what to do she'll she'll she'll ask me um and then sometimes she just calls me to run things by uh or just like to complain about because i'm sympathetic um or empathetic and uh i just i'm just there to listen and i don't need to give her any advice so i think a a good listener and good advice giver i procrastinate a lot um i start projects and i don't finish them uh so that's what i'm working on right now is finishing up a lot of projects that i've started over the past few months a lot of them are really creative projects and um i'm very enthusiastic about them when i when i start them and i'll get almost finished and then i don't know what happens i just completely lose interest um sometimes i think it's because i'm afraid to finish them which sounds a little strange but um i i'm working on that i'm trying to get those done oh gosh <laughter> um not following through on the opportunities i had when i got out of the peace <p> peace corps there was a lot of things that i could go into i could've gone to get my master's degree um with on a grant and things of that sort um but instead i got pregnant and got married and i had a wonderful job that i really liked and really enjoyed um but then when i got pregnant the second time it was right at a time where i had to fight for a directorship and i realized my limitations where i i couldn't be pregnant and have this child and and do everything i needed to do to get a directorship and so i really wish so i resigned um and i wish i had stuck with that um 'cause then i would have a have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding and solid career um not base decisions on emotions sometimes i um and not i i've had some really bad bosses um the jobs were wonderful um but my ego got in the way and i would've told myself to let go of that aspect of the job let go of the the egotistical reactions that i had to the bosses and concentrate on the job and doing that really well um my children actually um and also uh my peace corps experience was just phenomenal um and uh people are actually really interested in that and they were like an awe that they actually know someone who actually did that um so that that's i'm yeah i always when i was a little girl my neighbor was one of the first people to go into the peace corps when it first started and i always said oh i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day and then finally i got to the point where so i'd i either had to shut up or do it um so that's that was one of my prouder experiences okay thank you bye
420,male,0,3,okay  thank you  and please  are you okay with  yes I am  oh my mocha  Chicago  back and forth over the years and traveled a little bit  haven't been out there over 15 16 years  kind of got stuck out here then I have my baby and I just ate  different food the people get along way I don't get it it's kind of a culture shock  tell me about  out there just on the food bases they like to give you a lot of food that tastes real good for a little bit of money to keep a lifelong customer but out here they want to go up there and give you a little bit of food for a whole lot of money so they just make it Mike  parent have business out here  not our got to get used to anymore  the views in the ocean  just splitting of people that's it  just a few places  what do you enjoy  getting in to see different people on learn how different people get along and interact with each other  I want to hear about your trip  I remember years ago where I went to Mexico with my brother  yeah  jumping into a lake pretty much off the side of a mountain  yeah  everything  it's not a subject I don't like  actually my dream job  working with computers and helping people  that's  where my heart is I like computers and also like helping people  sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver  I meditate workout  I'll run I walk  alright read  in the median  I'd say very good  oh yeah that doesn't make it seem that good last time I argued was over someone actually spitting out a racial slur or it's my wife  angry  upset her disrespected  and especially when I went up there that treat the person actually I was treating them with dignity and respect and trying to help the person the first  no problem people are people  how to Chance in school with a really go a lot further than I did  and I let something very small and meaningless stopped me in the pursuit of it  ignorance  for lack of a better word  now that I think back on it I could have done a whole lot to avoid it but I was just young and foolish  start loving again  much pain as I've seen in the world  tell me about  a compilation of all the events are just different bad things that I've seen  if I could change it I would but sometimes  I guess things are there for a reason even though we may not understand it  I have no answer to that  blood family really don't talk  my wife  don't know if she really wants to be there with me or not she thinks that I'm doing everything in the world but that I'm not really  I don't understand I know my daughter loves me but I don't know if she wants to be with me or not  because  when somebody talks to you  when I say something a certain amount of times in the tonnage in a voice and a belief in their eyes  if you say something so many times it would really lies in your heart so you can say whatever through your mouth but it's what really is there  I love my daughter  she's Angel I'll cut her umbilical cord went out there and put on her first shirt  I seen her come out  she looked at me right out the stomach she wouldn't she was fighting with the doctors wouldn't let him touch her a bit  I talked to her I told her to calm down I told her it was daddy she looked up at me grab my fingers and like just calm down and just let him do everything they needed to do  no it's constantly changing fast what you have to do on this day won't be the same thing as the next or the next after that it's constantly  what is a better word for  adjusting  the hardest thing I'll probably say  is  Spalding your child because you know you're doing it out of love for not learning the wrong lessons  seeing your baby smile and appreciation  I try to guard my baby a lot more from things that she sees  when I was younger there were a lot of things I seen that no child or adult should have seen and  I grew up  I swore to myself that always take care of my child and I wouldn't disappear  let her be around things like that  okay  my foster parents  can you tell me about  they basically showed me no matter where you come from  you can always strive to get better  okay  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  a good night sleep  it comes  the same just tired of yarn  have I been feeling  Ike  I have a wealth of queries and  a well that goal  within my grasp and it's just right out of my route because I just need that one  connector to really just  see what I'm capable of and I know I'm capable of a lot it's just  I need to make that connection  no  not PTSD no  I said yes but I don't figure on many more depressed or anything than any other person everyone has their different breaking points  okay  tell me about the last time you felt  my daughter's birthday on the 26th  can you tell me about  took her out to Chuck-E-Cheese she had fun she play games she was on bikes she was crawling through puzzle games man squad about everything  find loyal caring  what are some things you wish you could change about your  time to change  I would like to be more accurate  is there anything you regret  now getting to know who my mom was  what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  stop thinking about whatever else happened

am not at school right now um yeah i'm just at home <laughter>  my dream job would be um i would like to help other people as long as it's something helping other people uh i would like to help other people with like p_t_s_d and problems and stuff uh yeah just as long as i'm you know helping other people smile and you know relating my problems with other people  um i'm pretty <pr> i'm close well i'm really close with my grandma um eh my family it's just eh we're not like too too close we kinda argue a lot <laughter> yeah  um sorry what's an introvert  okay  when i'm annoyed um well i try to relax for a minute i usually just try to take deep breaths but it's hard <laughter>  yeah  i'm not so good at it uh my temper's gotten a little worse um i am not good at all at really controlling my temper um i need some help on that <laughter>  um no not really i mean no i guess it's not like as bad as like most people i've never like been in a fight or anything or yeah any of that  um i argued with my mom and sister yesterday it was just something stupid over like my sister is sitting was sitting in the front seat and she's a kid and it's like i'm i should be in the front seat so i just asked her to sit in the back and of course they start like yelling and arguing and it's like really annoying <laughter>  yeah it does thanks  my grandma she's always giving me encouragement and um she's a therapist a licensed therapist so she's always you know made it really really um  easy for me to have someone to talk to and i could always go to her so that helps yeah  yeah  my most memorable experiences well i had one really good experience um i went horseback riding and that was really really made me happy uh i love horses and nature that's the biggest thing that i love and it just made me so happy and so relaxed so that was a memorable experience <laughter>    um caring very caring always there to talk to um i don't judge i never judge i'm never cranky i'm never i never ever get like angry at anybody else just like my family you know but yeah just very nice caring and stuff <laughter> um things that put me in a good mood like uh music nature um i like to cook a lot i like to cook you know for my family talking puts me in a really good mood i love meeting new people meeting new people puts me in the best mood uh it's not easy um it's hard um sometimes it's it's really hard um   i don't usually sleep well so um yeah i have trouble falling asleep mostly  um i guess it's just like my mind will be racing a lot of you know sometimes it'll be flashbacks of bad memories um just you know thinking too much <laughter> um i don't know um i think just uh  stress you know a lot of stress every day just everyday stress uh yeah pretty much that's what triggers it <laughter>  um i just try to stay positive i try to think like okay well you know one day things will get better um   i just i try to call somebody and talk to them if i have trouble like my grandma  yeah  thanks when i don't sleep well um well i start to like cry a lot and i start to get really irritable um i get really depressed it makes me not feel well at all i get very uh it just is really really bad if i don't get sleep yeah  yeah  thanks yes i was diagnosed um three years ago  uh i just i didn't really know what was going on then i realized okay well they just diagnosed that and um i was like okay well this is the problem and it i just wanted help because it just when your mind is after you like that's like it's just awful to have your mind taking control of you like that  yeah  yeah it's hard  um yeah yeah i definitely always thought i had a problem i always thought something was like really wrong um i just always like kinda nervous around people like i never can really like look anybody in the eye 'cause i'm just so nervous my eyes are always kind of like racing and i um would have sweats if i was in the situation um that reminded me of the situation like i just try to avoid what reminds me and brings those flashbacks yeah  oh um i i've been feeling good i've been getting out more every day i'm trying to um i guess walking keeps my mind off my p_t_s_d symptoms so i'm trying to walk more that helps  thanks um yeah i have depression um yeah  um it helps yeah it actually does help me a lot um i currently don't have one right now i'm actually getting a new one in a few days though like it's kind of a mix-up but yeah it really really helps me  um i noticed that i've had less flashbacks and um i've been more relaxed i guess and um yeah just you know trying to keep more occupied yeah it helps  um the last time i felt really happy um i guess um i don't know um today 'cause i mean i'm glad to be part of this <laughter>  um most proud of uh well <sigh> um i'm trying to think of what i'm most proud of um  i  think i'm most proud of like the fact that i am able to you know not be like well i mean most people i know they like deny that they have a problem and i'm proud that i can actually like you know be a person who can realize okay i have a problem and i need help but a lot of the people i know they don't take medication they're untreated and um they just don't wanna get any help and i'm glad to get help because i don't wanna feel that way and i wanna get help for the problem instead of doing that  oh gosh there's a lot i regret yeah there's a lot um i regret you know uh drug abuse you know but that's part of you know the p_t_s_d i regret um a lot uh mistakes you know relationships stuff like that  wow um i would've told myself to um i guess the advice i would've given myself was to  try to keep my mind more relaxed i guess yeah um well i'm a very nice person and i always like to smile people are always saying how i smile a lot but um the smile i guess it kind of hides like what's on the inside but you know i'm pretty depressed you know but i just try to keep smiling and i always like to lend a hand to help and make people feel better

365,male,1,12,<synch> sure i'm doing alright new jersey yes three months ago not very often uh it's much different uh i don't know it's just <laughter> it's a lot more crowded here to start a new life for myself it wasn't very easy at all <sigh> uh it was uh it was quite rough at first but you know i'm still trying to get used to life here i've met some good friends here um you know i love the hollywood area um and just you know the mountains are beautiful that's kinda things i love hmm the traffic not really no i don't just haven't had the time or the finances to digital media well i've always loved you know <deep breath> computers and you know designing things and uh i don't know i just kinda fell into it no i dropped out well i i guess my dream job would be working <deep breath> in something that uh i went to school for you know i i never really completed my education um but i guess it'd be great if i went you know back to school and you know finished you know my degree in digital media and uh you know finished and uh started working you know doing something in that field a little bit of both you know i i can be shy at times but i like to push myself to be outgoing you know it's kind of a a struggle for me but i i don't wanna be you know in a shell so i kinda force myself to be outgoing listen to music i uh sometimes just drive and um you know play music in my car and that helps me relax or i smoke a cigarette oh like what ooh um <laughter> just heavy metal that's all i listen to is metal well <sigh> it depends on how high my stress level is and how angry i am but i i do my best to not get so pissed off <laughter> scrubbed_entry and i don't know she um she wanted me to to come and pick her up uh she was a little drunk and uh we just kinda fought over the phone all over some other things and i just ended not picking her up because of her attitude on the phone with me <laughter> yeah it does something i feel guilty about is uh not talking to my kids uh often or as often as i should i've just been so busy with trying to get myself all situated here that i i don't really have time to you know talk to my kids as much as i'd like to you have no idea um it's it comes natural but it's no way easy and uh it's it's the hardest job that i love to do but right now it's extremely difficult for me because they live so far away and i i made this choice to come out here to l_a and i feel bad that i don't see them you know but the reason i came out here was to better myself so i can provide for them fear you know fear <f> just fear will you know you <y> you fear what's gonna happen to your kids you fear that something awful is gonna happen and not seeing them it brings about that fear a lot more you know and i can't i can't always be there with them i can't see them you know it it wasn't as bad when i was living in florida um and i i at least i used to see them it wasn't very often but i used to used to see them now i don't see them at all and that's the that's the hardest thing i've had to do as a parent is to step away from my kids if only temporarily i don't know how long i'm gonna be here for i don't know what my future holds but the hardest thing is being so far away from them just the the joy that they bring to me i mean i could be having a bad day and they just cheer me right up i mean i eh it sucks being away from them for for so long and they're so far away and just not seeing their faces that's it's it's the worst thing ever you know but i i love to just see their faces they they just bring a smile to my face and um i don't know well um i think the fact that i can get down to their level um i'm i'm a bit goofier <laughter> as a father than my dad was with me my dad was you know strict all the time sure he used to you know laugh and play with us but you know he was always very reserved you know and he kinda held back a lot he a lot of his emotions just because you know he was a he was a strong very tough guy um but with me i i i'm very goofy and silly with my kids and i'm strict when i have to be but i always love to you know play around with them as much as possible you know not i don't want them to grow up too fast and that that may have been yeah well <sigh> a situation that i wish i would've handled differently there's so many <laughter> uh i guess when i was still with my ex-wife in florida i wish i wouldn't have gotten so angry or i wish i wouldn't have let her get the best of my emotions she had a tendency to get underneath my skin and uh you know keep picking at me until i exploded and i allowed her to do that you know i i should've just walked away when i could and um you know not let my temper get the best of me no no no uh sometimes it's hard um sometimes i just lay awake in bed <sigh> you know thinking all the things that are going through my head all the you know all the stress that i'm going through with work and you know making sure you know wondering if i'm gonna if i'm gonna be able to make you know rent you know wondering what my kids are going through you know when i'll see them again if they even care about me anymore if they even know they have a father you know those are some of the things that run through my head and and that keeps me up at night sometimes a little <sigh> but <sigh> you know i put myself in this situation so you know i i gotta bear with it you know i gotta you know you reap what you sow so i <sigh> i gotta deal with it in my own way lately um i've been trying to not think so much about you know all that's going into my life uh i try to distract myself and that kind of gets me in a better mood you know if i'm hanging out with friends or just watch a little t_v something to get my mind off you know all the stresses in my life um the last time i felt really happy uh was actually a couple of nights ago i went out drinking with um with a couple of my friends from work and um i don't know we just got pretty drunk and just <laughter> that kinda helped me to forget all the crap that was previously going through my head so if if i can distract myself if i can forget about all that other stuff then i'm happy <sigh> some of my best qualities i guess that i'm convincing <laughter> um uh i'm kind of like a i guess you would say a counselor to some people you know some of my close friends you know i may talk people into doing things that they may regret or i may i mean i'm sorry take talk people out of things that they you know may end up regretting or i may um you know just listen to people so you know eh i could say that you know i definitely you know listen to my friends and help them out in their time of need when they're going through something troubling times like like i'm going through scrubbed_entry uh who lives in florida you know i talk to him every now and then and he's been having troubles with his girlfriend and you know i just kind of talk to him about his problems and listen i mostly <mo> i mainly listen because you know i don't think he has anybody else to listen to you know when i was living in florida i was uh very close with him so you know he he'd always relied on me and now that i'm here in l_a i don't wanna lose that you know connection with him because i mean i've always been there for him so he um he relies on me to listen to his problems and give him some advice you know about what i think you know he should do um so i think <th> i think he appreciates that and i and i'm glad that he you know relies on me for that uh he trusts me enough to tell me all that stuff <laughter> i don't know <sigh> um sometimes i wish i wasn't so kind or generous it seems bad but sometimes i i don't know people may take advantage of me and i may not realize it and um i don't like saying no to people i like to always please people so if i can change that maybe i wish i wasn't such a people pleaser sometimes financially in trouble <laughter> <deep breath> sometimes i you know it you know help others and not you know that may make me broke sometimes yeah i may not have enough to pay bills but i feel better helping people i don't know i regret not breaking up with my ex-wife sooner i regret <re> i regret <re> because she put me through so much crap in my life and um i was always trying to be a people pleaser i was trying to please her you know trying to please my kids as much as i can by not breaking up you know the family but you know there's only so much one person can take and i i think probably if i would've left sooner i may have been happier and things may not have gotten so out of control out of hand like they did you know during all those years with her so maybe if i would've got out sooner i don't know i would've been happier i guess um it's okay to be selfish it's okay to you know think about yourself sometimes you know if you keep putting everyone ahead of you then you're not thinking about yourself you're not thinking about what makes you happy and even though pleasing people may make you happy uh you have to think about yourself sometimes too and about your needs because you know you play an important role in the lives of your close family members and um in order to keep everything afloat you sometimes gotta xxx gotta worry about the one person that's you know juggling everything and holding everything up which is yourself so be a little selfish sometimes it's okay <laughter> i don't even know what a weekend is anymore my ideal weekend would be locked away alone in my room watching movies listening to music just with my cell phone off and not you know being with anybody or it could be out at a bar you know or you know watching a a metal show so i like to be alone but at times i i do wanna be out with uh with others i like you know being around people crazy <laughter> he thinks i'm uh i'm crazy for coming out here but i guess he would say that i'm dedicated and that i'm strong-minded and that you know whatever i set my mind to i can do it you know no matter how hard it is i'm not gonna wimp out so i mean i i really respect him for giving me his insight but uh i guess yeah i guess he would say that i'm crazy but strong-minded <laughter> my kids <sigh> you know that's the one thing that brings joy to me you know like real real joy are my kids and you know just having them in my life is is the proudest thing i can ever accomplish is just you know having them in my life and although i don't get to see them as much even <e> even when i think about them just thinking about you know how far they've gone you know what what they've accomplished in their you know in in their short time i mean eh yeah it makes me happy and i can't wait to see them again one of my most memorable experiences i guess that would be scrubbed_entry in florida you know going to see our uh you know our favorite band skeleton witch it was it was a great night overall you know one of the night's i'll never forget just because we'd

470,female,0,3,okay  chat look like straight up there or are look at the screen  okay  okay alright okay thank you  yes  I'm doing okay  I'm from Los Angeles California  the food the weather in the people  I don't know it's not too many things I really don't like about La maybe some of the bad people or some of the bad environments in LA  I'm sure you can  no not too much  I only been like to Texas Las Vegas and that's pretty much it  catching a airplane to Houston Texas like back and forth to visit my dad and going to Las Vegas that are  oh yeah well when I was younger I used to go visit my daddy cuz he used to live in Houston Texas and I used to catch the airplane a lot and that was a lot of fun I wasn't scared that was a lot of fun and I enjoyed that  when I went to school I study Child Development and nursing  I know I wanted to be somebody and when I went to school I wasn't sure what I wanted to be so I kind of took nursing the LVN program first and then I didn't want to be a nurse so I changed my major to Child Development and I graduated from that  no I'm actually looking for work I'm unemployed right now  my dream job will be probably doing something working with the kids opening up a nursery or something my own business  in my mind is simple but like in reality it seem like it's kind of difficult  sometimes I'm shy but I'm really an outgoing person I'm a people person  to relax I listen to some slow music. Kind of like have a quiet environment and maybe lay down and watch a little TV or something  I'm very good at controlling my temper I don't like to get really angry or upset or get to where I'm going to hurt somebody  when I really have arguments there like because people don't agree to disagree and if it's like really Petty it's like we might say it's just like my opinion and they don't agree with my opinion so we argue about that but it's like nothing really big or anything like that just stupid I don't even remember  when you feel guilty about  probably not working right now I need a job  yes  maybe  I don't really remember a situation I've tried to really think before I really handle a situation and I try to handle it in a my best positive way before I really do something I regret  being with somebody like a guy you know if I want to continue a relationship with them or just be single  my relationship with my family I don't have  I just really stay with my dad and I have a daughter and we just stay close all my family there either in Houston Texas or they're around but I don't really socialized with a lot of my family  my dad  because I live with him right now I've been staying with him maybe about 5 to 6 years and  he's just the only one I really look up to I don't really have nobody else around me to really look up to and  that's it  she's in a fifth grade she's graduating she's going to the 6th grade and I'm kind of excited for that  you find it easy to be a parent  sometimes is easy but sometimes it gets a little overwhelming  the hardest thing about being a parent is being a single parent  it's just you always have to have somebody to bring you Joy I enjoy always doing things with my daughter is just about making a lot of sacrifices and just always is brings me so much joy being a parent  well my parents when I was younger they lived apart so my mom  I don't know I'm I'm a much better parent cuz I'm more interested about what my child wants to do I'm involved in her life her every step just I'm really fully in my parents wasn't really that involved you know they had a drug problem so it just at the mature a lot faster than a lot of other kids  so  it was  just  my parents and  their drug addiction I wish I could erase that from my memory  now I cope with them well but when I was growing up it just was rough it was very rough had to do a lot of things on my own they wasn't involved in my decisions in life you know I just I didn't know how to really grow up and be a kid and which way to go or anything is just was like I was in the world by myself  yeah  all is very easy asleep will every night I couldn't sleep anytime I sleep very well  a little sad but most of the time I'm very happy I'm just not happy with where I am in my life right now  not really I really I try to think very positive and try to do whatever I can every day to look for work and just stay positive and focused  no I haven't  no I haven't  the last time I feel very happy was when I graduated from college I feel very happy that was one of the best things that happened in my life and that was the last time I was really really very happy like that  I feel like I was on top of the world I feel like  just overwhelmed with joy just everything was just so exciting for me that day I was just very very happy nothing can make me upset that day I was very happy and when I think about that day it is it's a very happy experience for me  right now I don't really have a best friend I really tried to  I tried to eliminate a lot of my friends because they wasn't really making a lot of Positive Choices so right now I'm just like I really don't have any friends right now  my personality I'm a happy person I'm an outgoing person and a positive person and a good mother  insecurities like sometimes I feel like  I have a lot of weight on my shoulders or something I feel like I can't get through something I can't get to the next step sometimes or just feeling down sometimes  well I did have a friend and she was like bipolar and I tried to really be your friend no matter the disease she had but she was in a really good friend because she one day she start this being very negative and just talking about me like we were enemies and everything and it didn't really make me feel too bad about myself but it just made me pick my friends very wisely  yeah just being friends with turn people that don't have positive things going on with themselves or just don't it just when I notice things about people that should determine whether I want to be there friend or not you know they might have bad qualities or just some bad habits they my smoke cigarettes or drink and I should notice that that's a red flag and I shouldn't be these people friends  to stay in school stay positive stay focused and surround myself with good positive people and just stay on the right track  well I went  to a friend's house that I haven't seen since childhood and they  is it a lot of people over there and they had a barbecue and everything and I really enjoyed seeing my old friends that are then seeing a long time and just being with my family and certain friends I really enjoyed because I'm really always in the house I really don't go out that often so just I enjoyed being with a group of friends and family and having a good time yeah  I'm proud that I did get my GED I did graduate and I do want to be somebody and I'm very proud that I want to be a better parent than my parents  thanks for sharing  thank you goodbye  okay

353,female,1,11,yes  i'm okay  um pennsylvania  mhm um well i was in boston for a couple years and then i moved here about three and a half years ago but um i just wasn't satisfied with the quality of my life um maybe once or twice last year i only got to back once a year um definitely safer and um definitely a more um well i just miss it 'cause i have a lot of family back there but l_a is okay i i mean everyone loves the climate here um  not too easy i have two really good friends here and i have a boyfriend i've been with for three years so that helps he's from here but um it definitely took a a bit of adjustment  no um advertising communications  um no i'm currently working in actually i'm not working right now at the moment um i wanna be an osteopathic physician  um so basically versus western medicine an osteopathic physician is someone who helps someone with the symptoms and doesn't just treat the symptoms but treats them as a whole person so they look at nutrition they look at diet exercise um just a variety of things to <t> to actually get someone to live  a healthier life versus medications or things that are commonly prescribed now in the western medicine  um well one of the great things was when i came out here to l_a i was um exposed to the degree which i had never heard of living on the east coast   um sometimes  um well i'm very particular about the people i like to surround myself with um and eh i don't like to socialize with a lot of people i mean i tend to um like small intimate groups and i don't tend to like to be in larger or bigger groups um eh when people don't take into account other people's feelings  um i usually  try to go for a walk if i get <laughter> very irritated  um i'm usually really good it really takes a lot for me to spill over and to yell or become upset   um <sigh> let's see uh mm i was at with my lawyer and it was about his handling of my case  yeah it was he's uh they're i don't know i think they're just a little bit mediocre they're not the best lawyers   i have no idea <laughter>  um i'm very trustworthy i'm loyal um i care very deeply so i i like to try to help other people um and i always like to try to cheer people up so <laughter> i think that's that would be some of 'em  no yes  um just a few months ago about in the last six months  um i was experiencing  mental issues that i'd never really came across before paranoia and anxiety and i knew that it wasn't  um i knew that i it wasn't that i couldn't overcome it by myself  um a lot better i've been doing a lot of yoga and meditation um kinda seeing things from a different per view or another <ano> not per <pe> per view but a different view and um  that's helped but there's definitely times where i kind of sink back into thinking about the event especially because the event caused me to stop working   um  i think i you know i have a difficulty being in public um i'm still dealing with anxiety and paranoia about that and that something may happen so um so a lot of times during the day is when it happened so i'm not that comfortable going out during the day i tend to go out in the mornings and evenings and um i don't like to go into places where there's only one way in and one way out um well i've been gradually trying to increase how much i'm outside um  and i usually just deep breathing um i do a lot of breathing exercises and i just try to say that basically what i'm thinking or what's going on with me is not real um and that   i just i try <laughter> i just try to get myself to go into these places more gradually a lot better since uh the last couple months but before i very much pretty much stayed home    um  it's been good um it's been good to hear someone's feedback but um i feel like i've gotten more help with just my inner talk with just kind of sitting with myself and journaling  i do  um <sigh> well i feel like more like myself which is a huge improvement um and i am more cautious and er guarded in some ways about my thoughts um and about my decisions as well i'm not so i'm not so oh you know i'll just do this and not really think of the consequences of other things that i want in my life   um it's gotten better i'm okay <ok> i'm better now um the first three months it was very difficult i couldn't sleep through the night and i woke maybe two or three times and would be awake for a couple hours but now i am um sleeping through the night again  um i feel <f> groggy <sigh> k i feel foggy and out of it um  and just low kind of depressed  mm <sigh> it's um i think it's been awhile  um working <laughter> i'm a bit of a workaholic um spending time with my family um yeah just being outside enjoying nature reading um very close  what is that  um scrubbed_entry um well my parents 'cause they've always been very supporting and loving um giving me feedback about my decisions or what i'm choosing to do but allowing me to make my own um decisions my own choices in life and then  my sisters have just always been very um you know just always checking with me i'm the baby i'm the youngest in the family so they always um  looking out for me and just checking in with me and then my boyfriend xxx with this um incident that happened um he's been very uh usually supportive with just letting me kind of have my talk and work things out and understanding when i'm feeling and not wanting to go out in public and and being aware of that that it's not so easy for me just to do something like grocery shop or um running errands without having a lot of anxiety  um i'm most proud of  the jobs the work that i've done the people i've helped um  maybe that i took this job where i was assaulted at <laughter> that would be it going into retail into unsafe environment not listening to my gut  um  what advice would i what uh to recklessly pursue your dreams um that there is no such thing as too late or running out of time and and to enjoy every moment of your life not take anything for granted  um  let's see uh <sigh> well cooking i really enjoy <enj> i really enjoy cooking um  so i made some roasted vegetables just any time i'm cooking i just really enjoy it um we have a garden so we had collard greens that came up and um some chilis and cauliflower so just using preparing that for <f> um for my um boyfriend and i  mhm bye thanks 
314,female,0,1,don't I look gorgeous you straighten up a little bit here  okay now you're going to chat with her for a bit  okay  yes  quite well I feel good  Los Angeles California here  one of the few native-born Los angele ins  I homeschool my ten-year-old son and I'm a homemaker I have five children and married 22 years  about the full-time job  somewhat we can we went to Israel about two months ago for a pilgrimage with our church yeah so I would say yes I've traveled a bit  I will most recently we like 2 months ago we went to Israel for a pilgrimage we were gone about nine days and was fabulous it was we spent the first five days in Corazon which is near the Galilee and in a place called I mean the name of the area is causing but we stayed in place called The domus galilaeae which is  a house for that welcomes Christian pilgrims as well as Jewish pilgrims  I enjoy like really the most important I dress like meeting the people and and of course seeing that the history especially Israel amidst the totally ancient but most dangerous is the the people I think to get a better understanding of how different cultures  live  no not at all  just don't I have all my life I've always been  open and and willing to socialize and I remember my younger brother I was joking saying that I would talk to anybody and I will I'll talk to just about anybody just because I enjoyed learning about other people  most of the top five by the end of the day after I've cooked dinner and we've had dinner together as a family I there's a word game on the computer that I like to play for a little while and then watch TV have a cocktail with my husband and just relax that's what we do and you know because we have a lot going on we don't stay up too late song  like to watch crime dramas  really mad probably not a lot  I get frustrated with for example my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever so that that gets me angry but  in terms of like really getting like heated Langer I mean other than like little things that my children do you know especially my oldest child is 21 you know he can be confrontational cell  other than that nothing really gets me like really angry  haven't I have haven't felt that  contributing to society helping  helping to raise responsible people I guess  and of course the love and affection in the the sun and the excitement that goes with it and all the stages that go I mean like really right now I'm in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers I only had I have one 11 year old and the rest are all teenagers and adults so it's really fun because we're able to talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world and you know have to have a challenging discussions and that sort of thing so it's it's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and you know changing diapers and that kind of stuff  the hardest thing is that it's 24/7  you never not a parent you know it's and so you have to accept that and that's I remember when I first with my first child thinking you know when I brought him home from the hospital this is it I mean there's no going back you cannot change I mean I guess you could if you did something horrible but I mean the normal circumstances you can't change that and it's a permanent thing and  it is in some ways it takes away your freedom but in other ways it gives you a different sort of freedom  always  I'm sorry I didn't get what you said  some of the things that have been a positive influence in my life most importantly my church and my face but also my husband he's been a really  he's kind of his very like logical thinking and very grounded so if I get emotional or I get upset about something he's always we balance each other out likewise if he gets upset about something I'm able to balance him out so it's been it's been a great gift in my life  I don't think I'd be categorized as somebody with a temper occasionally I occasionally I get angry but I don't like have like rarely do I have outbursts I'm more more likely to you know to say what I feel not let it build up so you don't like my husband and I don't  rarely fight like have arguments that are yelling and screaming or anything like that it almost never happens because I like I said I'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot self I'm thinking something I usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up  usually I'm arguing with my older son because he you know he thinks he knows everything he's 21 years old so he has the know-it-all mentality and I'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all and you know I was like was on Hiller and more and he's very confident and very self  cell phone with the ra self-assured and so he thinks that you know everything he does is correct and he still has a lot of learning to do that's all  it is a can be  I think that many of them are spoiled and living environment of  of instant gratification which I think is going to be detrimental to the to the future of this country but  in a given that with all the technology we have is really not any way to go back so I I have hope that they will I mean I think this country was built on hard work and an ethics and hopefully our art the Next Generation and the generations after that can maintain that that standard of living I don't know if it's possible  as loving nurturing funny  we laugh a lot and  caring honest  things that I mean my best I have will actually my best friend is it's two people it's two sisters that I grew up with and we for some years took care of their mother was Alzheimer's before my parents got sick so I would had a very close have a very close relationship with them still do and so I'm considered the fourth sister so I would say that those are my best friends and and  we love each other very much is a good relationship  no  no  yes  most mostly mine early depression it was more anxiety probably it's probably been five or six years I mean I've had it off and on all my life but it was never diagnosed originally like as a teenager I think is when I first had started with anxiety but  other than that I let you know so depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control but now it's under control so I have a great huh  no I think it was what they call fleece free floating anxiety more of a organic reason for it in other words that there was a chemical imbalance  in my brain  I've been feeling pretty good actually the holidays were great good family gatherings a little stressed because we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out my dad is really sick and we've offered to move in with them they have a big home but we would have to do a lot of  some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around and so we're in the throes of that and so that's a big big change but I'm looking forward to it because I really don't want my parents to be alone as they get their in their 80s  so as I get closer to death I want to have my family there with them  not easy usually all my life I think I've always I mean I've always had at least I wake up at least once in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom basically  other than that I mean no not sleep well I mean other than that I sleep well but sometimes if I wake up like really early in the morning then I can't go back to sleep I'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep because I want my schedule is when if the kids are have to be at the school early and there's a lot of factors  sometimes it does  probably basically the same I think I might complain the bit like oh I'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know but I think overall I'm probably the same  my kids know I'll be there I'll tell my get though I'm really tired and they'll understand like my older daughter will be really helpful and letting my the. I will try to cook dinner or something like that so that you know  then they put you in a little bit more  not really not not no  not really. I think significant  actually yes I do I do feel like therapy is useful  well we had a situation with my daughter  she also suffers from anxiety and we have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently our we're about to finish a group with her it was a 6 months  group for DVT it's called and it's like a the first time that is the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers and it's been really good it's been very helpful it's just all about how to live in the moment and how do you know the actual physical and mental strategies to keep you or keep you from your mind from going crazy you know worrying about things or we know  in this case some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever so that's the focus of the therapy and it's been really good my husband and I both have been going with our daughter and it's been really really informational and really helpful I think  oh my God I was she was in a bad way she was being all suffering a lot and we knew it and we acted on it that's all  like  really joyful and happy I would say probably  probably would be in Israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the the ethic in Cana  so you know where the wedding of Cana took place that was really moving and beautiful and it was it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day we flew to Israel on so it was right at the same time it was beautiful  find meaningful and other than that I would say you know like other joyful occasions have been you don't like Christmas and you know family gatherings and you know my dad's birthday turned 83 on Christmas Eve you know that kind of think so  that's an interesting question I would say  once I get like things done that I need to do like if I'm have a lot of a lot of either work to do around the house or  answer one once I get them done I feel like I could sense of accomplishment  you know much like I mean I worked for many years in it as an administrative manager at UCLA and  you don't want to get a project done or you get your whatever month-end stuff done or there's a lot of different things that have to meet deadlines or so that feeling of like yeah I got it done you know so I think that would be a no for me the most  most recent way of feeling good and feeling you know like feeling accomplished  dream job  I think I've already lived it I'm also a birth Doula and yeah and so I've attended a lot of Earth and now I really only do it for family and friends and it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in is the birth of bringing a new life into this world so I would say that's probably was my was a dream job and I didn't know what I trained much after you know I did my managerial stuff and  with all it is and was awesome so I don't work at a hospital anymore actually the hospital that I work at is now closed but  but like I said it for family and friends  I attended a friend of mine's Birth by accident she up she happen to have the same old BS I did with all my children and I came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were freaking out close friends and you know her labor picked up quite a bit when I got there she wanted me to say she didn't want me to leave I hadn't planned on it so that was the first birthday I attended outside of it you know myself giving birth which is a whole different experience so after that it was really interesting and interested in possibly setting nurse-midwifery  but then I discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you even a lot more Hands-On one-on-one contact with the patient which is what I like  so I tried to do that at the hospital in Inglewood about 15 years ago cuz my son is 15 and he was a year Old Mill 16 years ago so  yeah and I've been  well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman is in labor but and you know also like for me I always tell my friends and family if they want me to be there dual that I cannot guarantee 100% I'm not doing it for business and that way and because of that I don't have like backup doulas that in case I'm sick or I'm not available somebody else could fill in for me so but so far it's been that all the women that have asked me I've been able to be there for some reason still there  the the only one that I missed was one A friend of mine from church who wanted me to go with her second baby I was with her for her first but her labor went so fast you didn't call me in the middle of the night and she was like two hours of Labor she would even if it called me I would have been there in time so I went really fast but other than that you know  yeah I've been I've been able to attend all the verse of people that have asked me to do  all of life or in your job  probably might my own births I mean my the birth of my own children  like there's an extreme  sense of Joy excitement relief because of course you're out of the pain and then like it's just it's just a matter of you know going forward from there but it's it's like something you can explain it's just it's awesome after you give birth so  and I've experienced both ways I've done both natural and I at my last job was a spy a C-section so I've had both both experiences  all right with my Fairchild had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when I was in labor it wasn't funny and she  she was not there when the doctor I mean it was my third child was  born very quickly after he broke the water and wolf my husband was there but she was not in there with the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble because I only had like two contractions after that and my daughter was born in the bed so for me it was great cuz I didn't have to go through any of the labor but I'm sure they weren't happy that you fill out a lot of paperwork after that  so  now what I get myself for 10 or 20 years ago  10 or 20 years ago is probably more not as some relaxed not as  like I feeling out my age that  I don't have the same concerns that I did then it's I don't worry about I don't worry at all about what people think about me I don't worry at all about what you know you know like why I noticed my daughters on Mom you can't wear that because people are going to say this I said I don't care you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that owe mom you have to dress like this or just like that or whatever so that would probably be at the wisdom that you you achieve with AIDs that you do see how life there's so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things  most proud of  probably my family like my husband and my my children I mean the fact that we've stayed married that we weren't intact family that my kids see every day how their friends suffer who who come from divorced families or single parents and they they actually Express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family so I would say that's probably it  probably the one of my best qualities is being able to listen to people and being able to not be judgemental through the years I've had a lot of experience with  people with problems lot of friends with problems people I know from church and it's just taught me that everybody has weaknesses everybody has problems and I don't think I'm better than someone else if you think you're better than someone else and that's usually to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough  okay  okay  goodbye  real quick
418,female,0,10,can she see me  okay  okay okay  and please  are you okay with this  I'm okay  I was born in Mississippi  when I was 2 and 1/2 years old but actually wasn't me all day was kind of Monica  yes  never  I was only two and a half years old I don't remember everything  things you really like about Olay  oh I like the beach I love all the restaurants the music thing just a general excitement in the Parks and all that  the traffic do maintenance on the streets all the potholes  the pollution  well I study a number of things at school I studied  at one point I was I I had major in public relations journalism specialization journalism then I also studied as a pre-law major and so I studied the law and then I also studied human and Human Services courses  mainly because I'm a people person and I enjoy helping people  that's great  what's your dream job  wow dream job  my dream job  I don't really have one right now  okay  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer  do you travel a lot  no I don't and I can't even see your shoes  sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver  what do you do  listen to music watch horror movies I love horror flicks and I have a fish tank tooth I like to watch my fish also like to play tennis when I can I haven't been able to play Lately though because of physical problems  can you tell me about that  it's just that I had injury drum mic my my ankle because I have anemia and and I got dizzy one night and I fell on my ankle and on my leg and so I'm just waiting for that to really heal but I'm planning on getting back into town this is one of the things I enjoy doing it really relaxes me  I really don't have a temper over the years I've learned how to do how to control that  probably would have been yesterday but there was no argument and what was it about  nothing that I can recall  what's something you feel guilty about  something I feel guilty about  there's nothing right now that I feel guilty about  a situation that I wish I had handled differently  I really can't think of one right now  the hardest decision  be absolutely hardest decision that I ever had to make was when my I have twins twin twin boys are grown now I had twins twin teen teenagers and I had lost my job and we were living in a motel and the rent for the motel was outrageous I couldn't no longer continue to pay the cable the type of money that they wanted so I had to briefly put my son under the and in foster care for 4 for a minute that was the hardest decision I had to make  schizophrenic and he had had he was born with auditory processing deficit which he overcame through training for a speech therapist and and school officials and he also this is he also lost his hair when he was 4 years old but  and then we turned 14 to schizophrenia came up so right now he he's going to supportive living environment is 27 years old he's come to terms with his mental illness and he accepts it now that I had problems in the past because he didn't want to take the medication to give him the medication and he hide it and stick it in his pocket or whatever so but he's come to terms with that and we will all have come to terms with that he's doing he's doing pretty good  that son he's 27 to Texas with his wife and he got a promotion to  so now he's in California to buffering California okay so that's a very good about that yeah  well I've grown children are grown children  not it's not hard to be a parent of grown of my grown children okay when they were younger it was difficult times okay difficult. And is this a good time to but yeah there's some difficult times  well the difficult times I really pretty much already alluded to Matt was when one of my twins got the diagnosis of schizophrenia can and they were in temporarily and when was in foster care and one was actually in an institution because of the schizophrenia so  and I lost track of the question  the hardest thing about being a parent at this point this point in my life there is nothing hard about it  what's the best thing about being a parent  the best thing about being a parent I don't know I guess it's just to see something that you created and developed into a pretty decent human being you know a person  smsa  oh a lot of ways well actually I didn't have two parents I had a mother and the father was never in my father was never in the home and he lived in another state so I have no contact with him but the things that I do  differently than what my mother did she was a strong disciplinarian both verbally and physically  and she had the tendency to see how group has tendency to be very critical critical and  opinionated and very religious  and swearing  for a look at people who were not that was me as if they were living life wrong because they were not going to church and reading the Bible and all that kind of thing  was that the park  the question  I don't get a good night sleep I don't sleep at all unless I take medication and that's that that's all there is to it I don't take medication I don't sleep I'll be up all night I will be up for days if I don't take medication  irritable  I'm tired  well  lately  you know just a little anxious really you know I just recently made a move to a new apartment has a lot of expenses and new experiences and things like that and I will new furniture and leave this and that that you have to get a managed to do all that but the whole thing was kind of stressful  POF  no not PTSD  we are  that was back in I think 2004  because my life has gotten so stressful to the point where it was either I had to do something or or in something to tell you the truth  yes  yeah I think it's useful you know what's a good sounding board you know someone to throw you know your concerns out and we'll discuss things that may be bothering you are good things to eat with medication  cuz I've been going to therapy the changes a lot of changes I've been more focused  more  hopeful  it is just been a good experience for me which is why I've been saying to go  really happy  well I can feel really happy by some currents I can't think of anything right now just like that and then I go back to how I was feeling so I can't really pinpoint anything really I mean  I mean something comes to me unexpectedly or things go right for a change and continue to go right as opposed to things going wrong all the time  that makes me happy when things go right how about that  something I did recently  but I really  can I live with somebody that I really enjoyed being really really enjoyed  recently  I can't think of anything  I don't have a best friend  my best qualities or that  I'm an honest person  I genuinely give people the benefit of the doubt everyone in my book  is as they appear to be until they prove prove it differently very generous overly generous  and I'm very I like to help other people I mean help them come on a personal level and help people problem is it gives me pleasure to do something for somebody that's helping their mouth  anything I regret  how so  it's only one thing I regret and that is sad  after my twins that became old enough to start going to school at the elementary school level  I was taking some courses as a pre-law major and  at the time I was married to their father turned out not to be a good  fit for me and  because of the stresses involved with him  well knowing that that was running and I was going to leave him I dropped out of college  that was my biggest regret  stay in school no matter what stay the course no matter what  but I'm a good person  I'm a good human being  fo  okay  goodbye  that's going to go go by are you done  okay  I was weird  I was a little weird I was a little nervous
367,male,1,19,are there any parameters aren't I mean is should I just talk naturally or just went wherever I'm comfortable okay I get there  one last thing  let you know when she's done I'm going to hand you the  okay  and please  are you okay with this  yes  how are you doing  I'm okay I'm a little  pensive I guess a little down but more or less okay  I was born in Annapolis Maryland on the East Coast  originally I moved because I went to film school and but then I decided to come move back to Washington DC to do some work and now I'm back here again  it's very different being from the East Coast it just has a different feel to it but living  La is very as a very different kind of attitude I guess and so it's a little difficult but I but I've gotten more used to it since I've been here  not at all when I left things got things are sort of I lost my job out there and so I had to move out here kind of quick to to be with  some people who are going to help me out and I'm just I don't know if it's strange just the right word but I'm kind of not really speaking to my family are old friends that off  it's not easy it's  it's kind of  I miss I miss a lot of people I miss my old life before I lost my job I miss some friends I miss a lot of the relationships that I had out there so it's difficult I mean it weighs on my mind a lot I feel like I failed and now I'm here and I can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard  you consider yourself more shy or outgoing  depends on the situation I think I'm out going when I'm comfortable and then I'm extremely outgoing but when I'm in a situation I'm not comfortable with this I tend to be a lot more shy so that doesn't really answer your question but  I have certain  I do I do a lot of writing I have certain music that I listen to as I'm writing and when I can when I can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world the music and the the thoughts just kind of happening really it can it soothed me it's like it's when I feel most relaxed I guess  when is the last time that happened  a few weeks ago I guess I was I've been working on a on a on a book on a novel and when I was really what I was really getting into writing it and  it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good I felt like I was accomplishing something and I was felt really relaxed  what was it about  it was about  guy who's searching for something it's  it's it's his last day on Earth and so he's going to find a person that he that he met and just  I was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes he has on Earth with her just because  certified it's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing  what made you decide to do that  well I've always I've always been a writer part of the reason I came to La was because of screenwriting so I wrote some screenplays and you know had a little bit of success with that out here and but since since that I kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and I've started to write more short stories and and longer just creative writing so I've been meaning to write a novel by just waiting for the idea that to really hit me  how hard is that  it's not easy the the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle I find it difficult I have a real love hate relationship with writing when I when I love it I just absolutely love it but sometimes I hate it because it's so difficult but it's worth it for the times when it when it's good  how are you at controlling your temper  good I don't I don't really have a temper it's not I mean most of my anger that I have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people if something is really really stressful if I'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation I can lose it but I've put probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life I mean generally I pretty much try to it when I'm upset I get upset with myself not with other people  when was the last time you argue with someone  last night I guess I got in an argument about whether or not  cleaning vegetables was necessary because of I forget but it well know it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because I'd already started cutting the vegetables and I thought that would be okay so it turned into this big argument and we did Google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and I I ended up being wrong on that one but it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow-up argument but it was a definite argument  okay  what's something you feel guilty about  lot so much  I was in a relationship that I really really better really wanted to work and  I ended up and it was partly due to I hadn't I was on that I wasn't on the right medication and so I was going like everything that sort of spiraled out of control and I feel really guilty about the way that that ended I mean I wasn't I wasn't mean but I was but I was getting more and more messed up and I couldn't stop it and it ended and so I feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not  and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again so  that was pretty that was pretty tough  you've done anything to avoid it  what some of it was was that  I wasn't medicated properly I mean now I've been to a doctor and I'm on medication that's  completely kind of I mean I still get I still get upset and I still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not I don't completely lose it for days at a time so I mean I know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if I had if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then I would have then it would have probably been different if I was who I am now then I would have I would I would be  I would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but I mean I could have  I don't know I don't know if I could have done anything different  things being how they were  I mean it's  it's possible I mean obviously  yeah because I mean that's what I do I I  take little I mean I take little things and I just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy I dwell on stuff and it's like any little detail that comes up I suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day I mean I still I still get I still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed and I feel ashamed about stuff that I did in high school which was years and years ago I which I shouldn't even be thinking about anymore cuz it's so in the past but I still get that feeling like I'm right back there  that sounds really hard  well it's not easy I've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it I mean I dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to slow my mind down that way but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better  well like I said I do a lot of you know if I'm if I'm writing or if I'm doing anything like I kind of have to almost  you doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely if I'm watching TV I have to be playing a game on my phone if I'm using the computer I have to be you know watching a TV show or a movie on you know on it in another window so that I can just keep my mind occupied during all that  I just need I mean I I wish that I could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but I just I can't yet  I need triggered by something  they're triggered by everything pretty much anything that I said I see if I if I if I hear somebody with a Dutch last name if I if I hear somebody talk about Wisconsin if I hear you know she will talk about  anyting you know I can reach back and connect to  to this it's really it's really  I don't know that's the thing I mean I don't ever get a break  from it  now  how easy is it for  I'm a very light sleeper so I'm awake and asleep and awake and is I have no problem going back to sleep but I generally you know don't  I don't know I'd never really needed much sleep so it's just only recently that I've really started to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep like I would I would usually stay up until 2 or 3 in the morning so that I could just be so exhausted that I would just calling out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work but now it's it's it's like if I do that I can't I still don't get enough sleep I don't clock out I still just sleep very lightly you know I get up I toss and turn all night you know and now  it's just it's  yeah I don't sleep too great right now  pretty I mean I don't know it's hard to it's hard to know I usually just kind of power through it and just I'm at I'm like how I am now I just I just feel bad  okay  how long ago were you diagnosed  I think  334 years ago  it was when I  I had been given taking stuff for anxiety for 4  years before that but then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you actually got this situation and we need to get you the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so  so yeah that was that was kind of a turning point but unfortunately it happened after everything went bad so  at the moment I don't know I don't really think I thought about it too much then but looking back on it I feel  it really makes me angry it really makes me you know given where I am right now it makes me really angry that I'm  that I had that I I lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain because of things that I couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me I mean I was paying I was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing it you know it wasn't  it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know I managed to find somebody who did work and I just yeah so I'm I'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now  there really wasn't any choice I had to I was I was a mess I was it was either  I was I was self-medicating it was affecting my work I mean it was everything was just there was a point where I really realized that I mean I just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and and all this stuff you know they just decided that I was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off  but it was at least that and not  firing me but but but yeah but so I got help but it was  but it wasn't soon enough  not not as much as I should  I go to a couple of meetings I go to I go to AA so that I can you know keep control of that aspect to 2 and there's a there's a therapy aspect that unfortunately you know being unemployed my unemployment ran out you know I'm time you know what I'm getting my medication from the city of La so you know I'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody so I have a psychiatrist that I go see but it's really  very I've only seen her three times in the past year so basically to keep my medication coming  then there's you  right  changes have you noticed  well like I said I mean  this the top I mean let's just take the AAA for example because that's probably the close closest for that I'm seeing with therapy right now just saying stuff out loud is just like getting getting the stuff out trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense  that you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a a therapist or just a room full of of drugs you know I mean you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something that you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing  you know better than I that I have been I mean  it is sort of a good it has its ups and downs you know I'm applying for jobs 5-6 jobs or more a day you know I never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to 2 to being self-sufficient again it's hard but that's like real world problems I feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control so now it's just I have to deal with real life witches  Jazz at the juices don't own challenge  it was probably you know a couple of years ago  I was I mean the thing that immediately comes to mind is everything was going well at my job I was making these great videos with this person that I ate that I was having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a Christmas tree  and we spent it all this time picking out the perfect Christmas tree and it was just  feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger  the bigger life  that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel  you know for that instant I felt like  a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and  I mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant I felt like a normal person a normal happy person and  part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that  I don't know if I'll ever feel that again  so  what are you most proud of in your life  probably the  probably this educate educational series I did educational video series I did for the National Science Foundation  it was it was really hard and it would but in the end it turned out really good and you know I'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about  in about the world around them so that I feel like that was a real contribution that I made to the world  I was part of you know it's part of my my job it was it was a we were trying to come up with with new ideas for because we were put together videos and stuff to give you know to two schools and everything and they had done this before but we decided to do something really big you know when there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of  and there was a lot to it and so it was probably the biggest  project that the NSF has decided to do and so we just kind of produced it  I guess  I don't

405,female,1,17,essential let you know and then you can let me know okay thanks  thanks  go ahead and move his cord behind you didn't get any way  hi hello  are you okay with this  yes  okay not too bad  I'm from Chicago South Side  I'm back in 1978 when I was 18  lately not much maybe once every two or three years  compared to the letter A  it's totally different you know horrible weather and  it's just a whole different atmosphere  let's see my mother had moved to Africa  I graduated from high school and I had a friend down here so I just thought well let me try la  very easy actually yeah I loved it from the moment I got off the airplane  number one the weather son is very important to me so I love the weather  I don't know just kind of a more laid-back atmosphere variety  of people  and now it's my my Homebase you know my friends that are family  that's how I like my family is here now  I guess the small hug earthquakes  traffic  just basic things like that really  I don't currently but I did throughout my life I travel quite a lot  I just seeing seeing other cultures and seeing more history and meeting people and  just fun at the fun of it as well  let's see what one trip I went to England  Ireland and Scotland and France all in you know one trip  so that was a nice variety  I guess you could say probably skiing in val de saire France  that was fun I'm glad I got to do that  that's great  do you consider yourself more shy  I'm kind of shy by Nature I've tried to grow out of being shy so I'm not fully shy but I was always an extremely shy child  but now here in Culver City this is my environment and I I guess you could say I'm not really shy and in my hometown of Culver City  I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got  to relax I like to just curl up in my bed and read my book take a nap watch TV sometimes on the couch in the living room just you know stay at home and kind of vegetate  pretty good yeah my tempers pretty level  probably with my husband  and  I can't remember the moment what it was about  okay  tell me about your relationship with you  well when you say my family do you mean  my family from childhood or my current family  okay well I guess my current family comes to mind I have two daughters and my relationships pretty good it's okay with them but they're teenagers which you know going they're going through a lot of hormones and they can be kind of bitchy and  and but I have hope that you know they'll grow out of bed and soon someday we'll have a really good relationship  and then there's the husband which  like I guess I could face soon-to-be-ex-husband hopefully soon we need to get a divorce but we're still together due to financial reasons  and yeah yeah so that that's not good relationship with the husband but  but since we have determined that we need to divorce  we don't expect anything out of each other so we don't argue as much so that's good  well  I guess our marriage  I wish I had noticed early on that  you know it was like way off from what I thought it was  how do you say oh my God  hardest decision  I guess leaving my first husband that was pretty hard  well you know we were married and I wasn't content I guess you could say and  I kind of just gave up on our relationship and now that I look back I think it's because  I want children and he would have been happy to never have any and so since I didn't have a father it was very important that I create children with someone who really wanted to be a father and so I was kind of at an age where I needed to start thinking about having children yet I was with someone who really was not into it so that I think that's one maybe the core reason why I was not content and I just felt like this marriage isn't going to work n so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not want to break up and  and I had to leave him because I just wasn't happy and that was that was very hard cuz  yeah  felt like I was hurting him which which I was him he survived he got over and now he's married with two kids but it was hard to leave him  tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from your memory  something I wish I could erase from my memory have to think about that  I'm sure there's something well  yeah there's some  I guess it'd be nice to erase from my memory a recent I'm not resend but an event in my  recent adulthood here in Culver City where one of my best friends  betrayed me by back years ago when my husband first got into real estate she and her family were growing and they really need a larger home and  we just assumed that you know that they would use my husband as their agent supposed to sell their current home current at the time and purchase a new home  and as it turned out they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent and yeah that was devastating  I don't think I've ever been betrayed like that so I wish I could erase that not cuz now you know this was back when the kids were really young  and  my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was let's say  6 Maybe  maybe five anyway her and my best friend's daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other we were pregnant together and they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we run into them in the neighborhood are they run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were just you know like two peas in a pod even those her their moms weren't talking to each other anymore so now they're 13 and 14 and they're in middle school together and they're still very connected in fact she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl and it's just a little awkward you know cuz now these girls are becoming really good friends  your friends and yet I still have this  bad memory of what her  her mom did to to me  that was about 1:10  about 8 years ago  I tried it I try to ignore it and put it out of my head which have been able to  in recent years  but obviously it still comes up  anyway that was that  not that easy I do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time I wake up and can't get back to sleep but or I finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up you know that that difficult thing  well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom and then  you know it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then I wake up again to go to the bathroom  so I guess that's the trigger as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there I don't know I think there's just too much on my mind running through my mind and the day I feel like I haven't accomplished enough during the day so  it's hard for me to just go to sleep when I'm supposed to guess  well I'm kind of used to it now so I just go on to the day probably looking looking tired and  like I'm kind of used to feeling tired I just do what I need to do and sometimes if I'm able to if I'm at home and don't have huge commitments yeah I might just like I said earlier just take a nap or something read my book watch TV whatever  lately have I been feeling  kind of down  on myself down on life  well I have this pending need for separation / divorce  I'm worried that I made a lot of mistakes with my girls now they're teenagers you know on the verge of adulthood  and so I worried that you know I did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance in their early childhood and now it's too late  like I missed out on a lot of things  and yeah I need a job I'm unemployed I don't know what I want to do with my life I know I want to do something and I just wish you know I never did finish college unfortunately because I was traveling and stuff  so I regret that extremely  and I need to get a job and be able to take care of myself cuz I need to  divorce and move on with my life so now I forget what the original question was but that's the state part of the state of Mo  no  yes  well  the first time or or or recently  the first time I guess was you know when I was in my early twenties I was just a little upset about constantly that was another breakup I had to make back then I was  in my early twenties and I needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting cuz I  you know it's hard because he didn't want to break up and I feel like I was hurting him and I didn't understand this feeling I was really upset  how did that was my first time having depression so I didn't really recognize it as depression but I went somehow I had the  knowledge or the I was able to take myself to a psychiatrist I remember I paid for her by the hour and she prescribed Xanax to just help relax me  and so I guess that helped me get through that and then I've had depression throughout the years just so you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as I guess it's usually a relationship you know  yeah so the most recent time I was diagnosed and put on meds that was probably about 2 years ago  no  money and I don't have insurance otherwise yeah I'd be happy to go to therapy anything that might help  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  last time I felt really happy  I don't know I guess maybe  when my children were born  I guess happy I just you know I always wanted children so it's nice  to have them  that's I don't know that's all I can remember of that and I guess I don't remember the good times too well I remember the bad times  something you did recently that you really enjoy  something I did that I really enjoyed  well  that's the way I am  Friday night I went to a friend's house and met up with five other girlfriends and we  we created vision boards and talked and had dinner at one of their house that was that was fun  we get to  stay in college get my degree  get therapy trying to become happy  yeah try to figure out things earlier in life  like  yeah  stay in college and and mainly I think the mean and what it all boils down to no matter what your depressed about it seems like  as soon as the saying goes in the  songs go you know it's all about money the world revolves around money in  having none that in itself is for depressing so besides relationships and different things that have happened in your life having no money as you know it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it so with that in mind I would definitely advise myself to get my college degree and to get a job and stick with it don't quit to go traveling and I'll just stick with a job sick with a company build up your seniority keep your benefits  and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of filled yeah that would have been my biggest piece of advice to myself  not much  I guess  just my daughter's you know there are two beautiful daughters and  I'm proud and glad that I was able to have children some people  aren't even able to do that you know and they try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so that's the one thing I mean I wanted five children and I always wanted a boy which I never had but I guess that's the biggest thing I can think of to be proud of  having my two daughters  I'm a very loyal  friend and person that's why when that friend betrayed me I was so devastating  yeah very loyal very  happy was I going to say I was going to say happy go lucky I don't know where that came from very I meant to say friendly and caring and  yeah I care about people  and I'm interested in people  and I care about animals as well actually that's another thing I'm proud of proud of being a vegetarian  yeah so my daughters and being vegetarian and I'm a vegetarian because I really care about feelings of other beings not only humans but animals to in  you know I don't think that animals should be tortured and live a torturous life just so we can eat them  so what was the question  remember the question  okay  you're welcome by  I did need the tissue one time so that's good  the other sister
377,female,1,16,"so when she's finished I'll just wait for a little more buttons not working I'm pleased  are you okay  yeah go ahead  okay  I grew up in Wisconsin and I lived in Colorado for a bit and then they lived overseas for a little while and then I move to California  I moved here at the end of June of last year so I guess it's been 8 months something like that  at the most probably twice a year  Well my own town is all of 5,000 people and there are a lot of cows and barns and Farms so the opposite of LA  good question I have always wanted to live in California so but I had to living in in the Central Coast  and I just have been coming down to La like once a month for different business and that working and personal development stuff so yeah things were changing in Santa Cruz for me that client I had who is really the main like Financial  Main Financial Source I had that relationship ended so I was totally free to move and I thought well I guess I'll give Ally a try and see what happens so  I give it a shot and here I am  no not at all very very big city  I lived in Dublin in Ireland was it which is also a big city but you know European cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy and  yeah so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging and  I'm not much of a world Explorer. I love to travel I love it I live in Ireland and I traveled by the Morocco and I was in Costa Rica on my spend some time in Mexico so yeah  I love meeting new people experiencing new cultures and like also not just seeing what's different but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go  I want to hear about one of your trips  sure well  I guess trying to think which is my favorite time of night there's amazing things about Morocco and Costa Rica both but Morocco's incredible it was like 12 days and we went to three different locations we went up in the atlas mountains are beautiful and  yeah it's a really really cool culture that was fun  my trip to Ireland I actually visited there which is why I decided to move there so my most memorable moment of that trip probably dozens but the first most memorable moment of that trip was being in a bison and leaving Dublin and going to sound to the countryside and seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is time is everyone is these pictures of Ireland or you know you see in films and it's green and Lush and gorgeous but you actually get there and experienced it it's like the pictures don't do it justice so incredible  I might have an undergrad degree in English and psychology and a psychology minor and I have a master's degree in women's studies  no I use my English in Psychology I work in marketing Communications so actually do sales so yeah the psychology definitely comes in to comes into play and so does my  I guess my undergrad degree in English but really like I took that on and and created something out of it because most people who get an English degree just teach and I I wasn't wanting to teach  what made you decide to do  too cuz I'm not clear on the question  okay  my job  wow  yeah my dream job is  being a  a motivational speaker and trainer and coach  I'm in traveling the world doing that and impacting people's lives and really contributing to people  my relationships pretty good actually I  I just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who would not she was sporadic I saw her sporadically growing up I lived my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and they had two kids together so I grew up and I consider them like the family I grew up with so but I got in communication with my biological mother  last May and we've been  clear things up and have been in communication since then  well not sure what you mean but if you're referring to being communication with my birth mother is very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and they do not just the future but in the present moment with her so yeah  I'm shy  time to relax I do a number of things I like to do yoga and I don't have the money for it right now I love to dance I love to read I love to go to the ocean and spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions that really retarded is my battery actually probably more than anything else  I like to be with friends I love arts and trying new restaurants  yeah all those things are  both relaxing and I guess they're relaxing in the sense that I feel connected to the people in my life and today experiences of my life so  yeah  how are you at controlling your temper  depends if I'm driving not very good but otherwise I'm pretty good at it  last night I argued with somebody probably would have to be  Ono is with the LA times that the newspaper delivery  yeah that was the last time  tell me about  yeah the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that I take care of it didn't show up and I didn't realize that it wasn't there until  I'm late I don't know afternoon I think early afternoon and then I called them and they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after 10:30 in the morning which is absurd to me when they made a mistake in the first place so I mean for service at and it would pay for it for every day so I'm yeah I was just really irritated and then I found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so amazing Ricky L E X I was angry with people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me I was pretty frustrated  Noel there quite a few of those  I think about 1  the other day I had a phone call  and I'm going to coaching program and  it was from one of the coaches in the program and she was explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls cuz we have one particular coach we work with and then she called to tell me that I was going to have another coaching call with  someone who's not my couch and that hasn't been explained to me it's part of the program so it's in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my God I have all these people I have to be accountable to and you know I have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just  so yeah I wasn't  I was an angry I was just I just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and I talked it out with her and we got through it but  yeah I could have  certainly just been okay with what for was being asked of me in the at that time and would have made the call go a lot smoother  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make  large decision while there's been a few  why is moving to Ireland was probably the hardest decision now it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was challenging  that was the hardest decision was the first time that I  moved away from my family I was 28 and I decided to I chose to move to Colorado and that's a pretty tough decision at that point my family had been within an hour's Drive of where I lived an hour hour-and-a-half and now they're going to be a 12-hour drive away or a plane right away so that was challenging  oh lots of things  I love Colorado Colorado is beautiful beautiful state and the weather is so much better than Wisconsin and at the time I was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor outdoor community in Colorado so they were a lot more people who were in my age group and or single that was another factor and we're interested in the things I was interested in so Colorado to seem like a really natural fit hell yeah and then I found a job that I liked the pay was atrocious but I found some work that was really rewarding and that all came together just move  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  I was totally unrelated question  relatively easily it just depends on like what time I go to sleep if I'm out and I don't get home until 11:30 then  and having to go to bed late and I wake up feeling tired like I feel today but generally I can sleep through the night I've had some pretty anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks but even so even when I wake up from those are five-star from those I still can fall back to sleep relatively easily  I'm sure they are I mean I'm in another transition state and moving out of  out of the house that I live in right now or take care of an elderly woman  yeah and I just I have to find  the financial means to support me in doing that and it's and she creates a lot of anxiety just didn't her state of being anxious exhausting and I'd really depressing  living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing I've ever done and I would never ever choose to do it again if I honestly if I knew what I was getting into I don't think I would have said yes to the situation  I feel trapped and helpless like this nothing I can  no way out of the situation that I'm in no matter what I do it doesn't get any better I did I don't know I'm not getting any kind of work that I want to do and my money's not working at all  so yeah I feel pretty crappy  I have in the past year  oh a long time I was 15 I think 14 so it was over 20 years ago  are you suicidal  you feel down  oh yeah I fell down  I don't actually now  well I originally stopped  with my therapist because we had completed I mean we had worked on what needed to be worked on and I was no longer depressed and and then I began therapy again later on think I wish it was in my early thirties and then I we ended that because I moved to Ireland so  yeah I'm in depending on the therapist and sitting on your intention like I I don't go into therapy thinking I'm going to be in this therapeutic relationship for the next 10 years I think that's ridiculous  I think you going to therapy to work on a specific problem and I have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board you can see things that you can't see and  we not work through that situation and come up with  a strategy for notches that not just in creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies and tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever  tell me about the last time you got  can I feel really happy  Zoe Sierra go  no that's not true it was when I  saw my biological mother which was last May  my best qualities  I'm very strong  very strong-willed  I  very supportive and loving and nurturing I'm easy to be around I'm intelligence  and  is there anything you regret  I don't think so  now  what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  don't take life too seriously  how ideal weekend, spend some time at the beach and spend some time with friends  either going out at night you know to a movie or just going out to  a club or bar somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together maybe go dancing after and Sundays I usually go to  and then I have brunch with friends and  may I go home and Sunday night and get ready for the next day so  I am most proud of  a few things that mean I've moved to places that I wanted to move to and so I've done things that have really spoken to me and if meant something been dear to my heart to actually  achieve those those  goals are those  yeah I've done things that I wanted to do like move to Ireland and move to California  okay"
421,female,1,10,doorbell back over here  alright great thank you  and please  are you okay with  yes that's fine  I'm okay how are you  originally I'm from San Francisco  originally I moved here in gosh 1995 then I went to Chicago then to San Francisco and then back to Los Angeles probably about 5 years ago  a lot of moving  never  there just isn't anything there for me anymore  the weather is better in LA but the people in San Francisco are nicer  my husband prefer my ex-husband prefers at here that's why we moved  okay  I have an undergraduate degree in Psychology and after that I went to law school  when I was in college I worked at a law firm and decided that I really wanted to be a lawyer it was really interesting  are you still working in that no now I'm a stay-at-home mom  you find it easy to be a parent know I loved it but it is it is difficult you have to manage a life to make sure that they become a good and successful person  it's easy to kind of do the academics and stuff like that you know I'm good at that the hardest thing I think is to guide them emotionally to help him through things that he's having a hard time with feeling like I don't have all the answers  I'm just seeing them grow and and experience new things and learn about life in the world it's just it's really really cool  what are some ways that your  completely different completely different and I am not a perfect parent but I love my son I take care of him he's the first priority in my life and they weren't like that at all  well my parents are dead I didn't speak to my dad at all before he died I have a sister and a brother that actually I don't know where they are I don't speak to them either  do you consider yourself more shy  probably more shy because I consider myself more reserved  I like to listen to music  like what I have I listen to all sorts of music but my favorite when I'm relaxing is that 80s music cheesy cheesy but true  it depends on who I'm with if I'm with my son I can control my temper if I'm with my ex-husband or other adults yeah I don't  so so  yesterday and it was about my ex-husband dating the woman that he was cheating on when we were married  can you tell me about that  I found out he was cheating on me and I kicked him out and he told me yesterday that he's continuing to date her  yeah  really angry  and just really hurt  I wish that I had talked to my dad before he died I wish that I had settled our differences before he had died  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to  the hardest decision I've ever had to make was actually ending my marriage  because he was cheating on me  that would have to be  well I don't know I mean I don't know if I'd want to erase anything from my memory because it makes me who I am today  but I can't really think of one event that I would want to erase  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep I don't get a good night sleep it's not easy I wake up a lot in the night  I don't know I wish I knew if I knew I could change it I could try to do something about it but I I just don't I don't know  what are you like when you don't  grumpy irritable  grumpy irritable down  mixed with anger  can you tell me about  it's just because of everything that I'm going through with my soon-to-be ex-husband  yeah there's  I just keep it inside  Meador Staffing else to really do except I mean it is what it is so  I have to  deal with it  no  yes  10 years ago after my son was born  9 years ago I felt like I couldn't cope with life  I was so down I couldn't I felt like I couldn't do anything  I need  no  I don't go to therapy I go to medication management but I don't do talk therapy  I have gone to a therapist and no they don't help  can you tell me if  well some just sit and stare at you and don't say anything you know if I wanted to talk to myself I would others give advice that I think is just  it just not not good and not on point  tell me about the last time you felt  it was probably this morning I was playing with my son  just really happy I wasn't thinking about  any of the other crap  in my life I could just forget it so I was feeling really really happy  I think they would describe me completely different from the way I would describe me but I think they would describe me as really sweet they have really sweet confident  outgoing because that's what I try to be two people so I think that's how they would describe me  I wish I wasn't sad I wish I was more confident  yeah there are a lot of things I think  it would be  to not  not give my life over to one particular person which is what I did with my husband  find your ideal weekend  I think I would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like Palm Springs with my son hanging around the pool having fun going out to dinner  one of my two of my friends to really good girlfriend so I think have been really positive influences in my life  can you tell me if  sure life is worse than mine and the but we can always commiserate together  is just really positive me she's always happy always up always look into the bright side so that has helped me a lot  my son  I went over to a friend's house and we had movie night we watch the grown up movie and had dinner and wine and the boys were in another room watching movies and playing video games and it was just a relaxed fun evening  thanks for sharing your thoughts with me  my  okay
617,male,1,12,wow  okay  I broke it  not so good  okay  all right questions and then when she's done she should say goodbye and you can press this button  okay  okay  should be how good  yes  I'm doing pretty good  originally I was born in Denver Colorado  I like the beach sunshine  pretty girls  the ocean  other things  smog  excess amount of people in traffic that can be dealt with  I would like to travel more  seeing new things and and learning perhaps if you culture or something  oh okay I when I was younger I went to Europe and just did the backpacking thing  backpack around Europe for a little while and it was it was real fun  I'm probably just being in the military with some friends and stuff like that  why have a degree in film and I'm finishing a degree in or for business as well  now I look for work I'm trying to do some sort of entrepreneurial effort now as I finish my business degree  it'd probably be to own my own company that's kind of why I want some sort of entrepreneurial effort to push push for with some sort of interesting product or service that I'd be working in  I would say middle of the road a little bit shy and at times can be takes a while to warm up  are you cautious to meet someone new and then from there  I kind of see where to go from there I guess  my family they still live in Colorado their interesting people and good as well as I talk to him  pray couple times a week they're good people I have one brother and he has a couple of kids and that he's married as well  that's a good question lately I've been trying to get a daily amount of exercise like jogging or riding a bike and recently got a bike  something like that on a daily  effort  for the most part pretty good I try to if I have an outburst or if I'm being irritable I try to stay away from people who didn't like to go off on people they didn't do anything wrong  Edward change the topic in my mind I guess  what gets me in trouble would be more I avoid things and it kind of builds up and becomes worse  and that kind of gets the trouble and  basically just in a relationship with a girlfriend  to be honest with that it remember exactly what it was about it's just probably in one of us is being irritable and me and  going from there or it's probably a lot to do with the money as well I don't have the best financial security at this point  that's a good question  oh my I guess I I do Harbor a little bit of guilt from the military as far as getting out and people are still in I suppose I know that's it's not for me anymore  only thing well I I used to work at for a friend and I invested into his company  and the economy went down was a construction accessory company basically and kind of movement down and we lost most of our money like most of the folks around America and that pretty much  it was a good and bad thing is you got to look at it from a good good perspective but it definitely put it myself into talespin I financially and couldn't really do anything about it almost was homeless for a little while  but I I wish I wouldn't have invested into the company and just move forward and  perhaps going to school like I'm going anyway  I have  I was 21  I wanted a change in life I wanted some more real-world experiences  answer my country and also the added benefits of going to school or nice I didn't have  much Financial capabilities at that time and I wanted to change to get out of my current situation and that was the best way out I thought  are you happy  yeah yeah I'm very happy I join the military I appreciate it now more that I mount and understanding kind of what I supposed war was about it is definitely changing people and myself as well  yeah I did a tour both in Iraq and Afghanistan as well  see I thought at first it was very easy and then I came to understand he was very difficult  just because I was adjusting from military life and still having that in my head and not until now I realize that I probably just a few months ago  to Reno reintegrate myself a little bit better and choose civilian life which it's it's actually it's actually pretty difficult  no problem  movie think I when I got out of the military  versus I'd I invested like I said into my friend's company and we started that little business we're doing well for the while working and then lost all of our money  and then I traveled for a while at a gender stand now is obviously some other issues but I traveled all over America good working and went to school in New York for a little while  lived in a few different states and came back to California where I'm finishing school finally  living the dream  that's a good question I would say  well it didn't and instills you with with very good I think since of  sense of character and strength and you know I think there's a lot of good qualities that the military are military puts a new people but at the same time it puts a lot of bad qualities  as well because you need some sort of edge or something that you need on on am almost daily basis and if you don't get that then in a lot of guys do you know turn into drinking or drugs just cuz you can't get that same Edge  and that really that can really either hurt or benefit you  I've been feeling okay I've had a bit of a sinus issues lately but I've been feeling okay  actually I have my my thoughts I used to really have scattered thoughts  and  I would say I'm starting to get a little bit better Clarity which is good  taking a lot of different therapy and stuff like that and it it's actually helped  it's it's very as I can't really let the tough part for me is the schedule because that's if I'm not tired you don't sleep you just lay there  it's Hit or Miss really some nights I can sleep pretty well some nights I have to wait till I'm exhausted  and I don't like doing pills  pills are bad I didn't understand that but it's basically just can't sleep because either you're on my mind is always thinking about something or something I feel that I have to do but yet I'm not doing anything that's not true trying to always do something or do you have some some troubling dreams at times but that doesn't really negate me from sleeping and wakes me up is what it does because it can't be that the dream that you remember versus the one that you don't  when I don't sleep well  perhaps your ability and anxiety definitely go up I I definitely get I have a tendency to get a lot of headaches  and not sleeping very well definitely puts that into the mix  I have  not that I know of no  I I don't know I try to feel happiness on a daily basis I guess what you could answer but I'm not certain  I'll say my my dad's been a very positive influence  that's a good question charismatic her funguy pretty tough  a good worker  I'd say I really enjoyed jogging  the other day on the beach  something that I am most proud of I would say I'm actually an online Minister as well and I married my brother and his wife and that was a pretty proud experience  all good  she said goodbye  okay
448,male,1,18,<sync> yes doing pretty good oh i was born in uh brooklyn new york i came out here when i was seven and i've been here ever since uh i don't consider myself anything but a californian <laughter> uh i'm a welder um i just i don't know something about it making and um building things and repairing things that intrigued me and uh uh i was actually pretty good at it so i stuck with it and and that's my profession <sigh> gee i really never had that i've just uh <sigh> kind of always uh hoped that i would have a job that could support myself and my family and uh i was satisfied with that well uh i just recently lost my uncle and uh he raised me since i was seven years old and uh other than my wife i don't have any more family um he passed away last uh july and uh i'm starting to get over it um i knew the day would come but he was my last living relative so i've been depressed about that and uh uh but i'm doing better it depends on the atmosphere um if i'm around people that i don't feel comfortable with i'm kinda reserved but uh if i'm comfortable and uh i feel like i fit in well i'm outgoing <laughter> <laughter> right i enjoy old movies uh old uh well it's called film noir and uh i love those old black and white movies and i get on netflix or amazon and i try to pick a movie that's uh from back then people were different than they uh i don't know it's just a different era and i enjoy it <sigh> well my wife says uh i probably not as good as i think i do but uh i've got to admit sometimes i lose my temper and it is according to her over things that i shouldn't be losing my temper about but um i'm working on it and uh i have basically had this problem ever since i was a young child oh yes <laughter> uh i've uh been in and out of trouble with the law when i was much younger i'm i'm passed that point now but uh <sigh> you know when you're young you think you know everything and uh you know you're never gonna get old and the future doesn't matter but uh it does matter because everthing that you do when you're young uh follows you for the rest of your life and i don't regret things that i've done but if i could go back i definitely would make different choices uh me and my wife we we <w> we don't argue we <sigh> disagree and it's she's very strong willed and she's a match for me <laughter> so uh we go back and forth but you know we don't get violent and we don't uh uh say meanful things or hurt each other we're just she is a determined strong willed woman and <sniff> i am who i am so we kinda go back and forth and lately i have been the one to <sigh> bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because uh in the long run it's just her and me and there's nobody else more important to me um <sigh> <tisk> when i was younger i wish that uh i didn't follow some of the people that i followed and what i mean by that is you know running in a circle with certain people and having an ego bigger than my common sense and um that's what got me into trouble <sniff> i was an only child and uh i kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and um getting the girls to laugh or having people mm think i was you know cool or whatever you wouldn't think that now i'm kinda overweight and balding but when i was in my twenties i was a a completely different person and <sniff> if i would've had some brothers and sisters i may not have thought or acted that way but i was an only child so i you know ran where people thought i was cool and that got me into trouble hardest decision i ever had to make was giving the authorization to um have my uncle pass away he was on life support and his kidneys had failed <sigh> and um doctors said there was nothing more he could do and to not have him <sigh> go through any suffering to let him slip away and as you can see i get very upset my uncle raised me like his own son and never let me down <sniff> and he's gone and for lack of a better word to push the button i never thought i would have to do that <sniff> but as i said i'm getting over it and um things are getting better slowly my wife she is uh always there for me <sniff> she will <laughter> always surprise me we she's not my wife she's my best friend <sniff> and she <laughter> knows me better than i know myself um <coughs> we enjoy uh uh doing simple things it's not that we can't do other things if we wanted to but we <sniff> mesh um <sniff> we enjoy each other's company uh we like the same things and uh we you know occasionally go out and do something together but we <clears throat> we just enjoy each other's company and she like i say knows me better than anybody and um it surprises me sometimes mhm you know <sigh> lately well i can't say lately <sniff> if i don't <coughs> excuse me if i don't do a rigorous activity or something that really uh stresses me or strains my body it it let's say for a couple of days i'm just very relaxed and you know not doing much i i just automatically get up after four and a half five hours i mean and you know my wife will say you know guy you're not getting any sleep but i mean i don't feel tired i don't feel exhausted i don't feel like i need to go back to sleep i'll stay up all day and i'm fine and most people would say that's not enough sleep but you know for me i'm it doesn't affect me <sniff> well i wish some things could be different but uh i'm not dissatisfied <sniff> um uh i'm happy with my life uh there there uh like with anybody else there's a few things that i wish were different and i think that's in anybody everybody else's uh you know life but um <sniff> i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm content yeah i feel a little less motivated <sniff> um recently well i can't say recently this was back in january um my wife and a few uh friends were noticing that i was um becoming forgetful and i i couldn't remember things i i didn't see it and um you know when they when everybody brought it to my attention then i started to but anyway i went to the doctor and um they gave me the tests and apparently i have m_c_i which is mild cognitive impairment and uh i've over the last month or so nobody has mentioned it to me i mean maybe i'm getting better but the neurologist that i saw <sss> is having me come back in a year and gonna retest me um hopefully it's not the beginning stages of alzheimer's i'm still a little young for that i'm only fifty <fif> fifty two but um i was diagnosed with uh mild cognitive impairment and uh it it could've been due also i was told by him uh because of the death of my uncle i could've been pretty depressed i was not able to retain things and so well i'm going back in a year and we'll see if uh i'm any better i'm sorry i'm not understanding you i'm sorry how <h no no i have not yes two thousand one um i was in a um uh what is the word i'm looking for <sniff> i was in a um in a state of mind of of where i was just going to get myself in trouble and and not benefit anything if i didn't seek any help um i was diagnosed with uh depression and anxiety disorder uh worrying and thinking too much about things and uh thinking the worst and uh i i take medication for that uh well <w> well you know it's not really therapy it's <clears throat> you know every uh few months you know you gotta see the doctor are you doing fine everything good and you know they just refill your prescription <laughter> it's you know it it's you know kinda like the next person next person it it's i i'm with kaiser so it's it's they'll talk to you but it they give you the impression that um you know i i okay let's move along you know they they'll <th> they'll hear your explanation but you know it it they don't have all the time for you that you may want so i i i i'm doing fine now if i really needed help i would i would do something the medication works for me <sigh> last time i felt real happy well it would depend on what the event is i'm always happy when i'm doing something with me and my wife and we're enjoying each other and i you know i'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and i don't have anything else she is my world but um i i i enjoy being with her and we're we we do things together and <sniff> i i i'm happy all the time when when we're doing that um <sniff> when i'm outside of that circle i i i don't know if this sounds right but i'm not seeking happiness i i can only explain it as i'm content i'm not um i i'm not disappointed or i'm not uh wanting anything i'm you know whatever comes my way is fine so well um <sniff> i don't know i i couldn't give you that answer <laughter> um <sniff> well my best friend is my wife but uh <sniff> she would um describe me as uh i don't think before i speak um i um let the littlest insignificant things bother me and i get angry over but the big things it's like i let it go and she's bewildered by that <coughs> um uh <vocal fry> years and years ago um she i had a uh classic uh pontiac lemans and she had gotten into a minor fender bender and she thought it was gonna be the end of the world 'cause that was my baby and i <sigh> you know hey don't worry we'll get it fixed and she was <w> she thought <laughter> that i was gonna hang her or something you know because that was my this was you know that was my baby and uh she goes you know you you get excited over nothing but you know i something like wrecking your car that you love and you've put so many hours of work into it and money you know it gets crashed and it's like you don't care so that's the only way i can explain it well i i need to lose some weight as you can see <laughter> i'm definitely uh been on an eating binge uh and uh the neurologist said that's probably due to the event with my uncle um i'm heavy <heav> i am this is the heaviest i've ever been in my life and i'm finding it a little bit harder um i i can't say harder but i'm i'm finding the will power to say no and to stick with it and to go exercise or you know not you know  movement now going maybe for a walk you know me and my wife when we were a little bit younger we used to love going for walks <clears throat> and we lived in a scrubbed_entry uh boy you know look at that wonder what's inside there you know that that's uh we don't do that no more i guess it's we're a little bit older now and <laughter> a little bit heavier it's harder to walk with all this weight <laughter> but i i i i wish i could change that because uh i i you know it's just not healthy the size <sigh> <sigh> uh lately no i don't regret anything lately um <sniff> everything's been fine the like i say the the biggest biggest impact in my life was the event with my uncle and uh i never ever in a hundred years or ever thought that i would face that situation and <sniff> i'll never forget it but they say time heals all wounds and and it does <laughter> don't listen to other people uh again i'm not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened but he used to constantly tell me to uh he would see the things that i was doing and the paths that i was going down and i constantly thought i knew better and i think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they um the young lady that i was talking to in here they think they're invincible and so did i <laughter> i figured ah i'm never gonna i'm never gonna have those problems um i wish i could've changed some things um <coughs> the history of my past follows me as it does everybody and that has limited me in in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that i'm able to do uh i don't miss them but if i could go back uh ten or twenty years i definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions that i made my welding certificates um i'm uh certified by the american welding society and i've uh <sniff> uh that's probably the biggest achievement that i've made for you know myself an accomplishment um <clears throat> uh people that i know say that i'm uh well i haven't been working on cars lately but they said that i have a natural knack for uh restoration and working on vehicles and i don't see it but i've been told that once or twice but i i've kind of i i've kind of started to slip away from that i don't i can't say it's from lack of interest but i just don't feel the motivation no more i wish i had a pocket of money and i'd have somebody else to it that's how i feel <laughter> okay well thank you bye bye

something that's possibly negative in my recent past um <sigh> what would i have done differently i've i don't i'm pretty in control of my emotions and taking the temperature of the moment and responding knowing when to respond and when and knowing not to respond um so nothing really springs  to mind that i wish i had done differently recently in my past past yes but not recently oh swallowing my pride putting my tail between my legs and saying i was wrong to friends sure scrubbed_entry um scrubbed_entry i contacted him again and then we're fast friends again mhm <sigh> <sigh> you know this is again this is past past so not recent past so um probably altercations that i've had with my uh mom you know things i've said to hurt her you know you know when you hurt the ones that are closest to you that sticks so any time any one of those situations you know so when i'm i think my emotional i_q has grown so i think in the past past my emotional i_q was very was stuck on infant <laughter> so so i have a good relationship with my mother and both my sisters and their families um my father never had a good relationship don't know if that will be possible he's still alive but he's in advanced alzheimer's so he's mad at everybody right now oh it's fine you know it was slow so someone oh um scrubbed_entry has been positive influence in my life um my sisters i talk with my sisters so extremely easy i sleep well each night about <abo> anywhere from at least eight to ten hours a night <laughter> yeah oh lethargic um <sigh> just going through the motions <laughter> you know um it's like this i'll frame it like this david lynch who is not necessarily mainstream he's done some crazy stuff as far as movies and t_v's concerned he said the idea of the angst-driven artist is b_s he says you wanna be creative get a good night's sleep i like that mhm good um i can't wait to get up and start the day oh um if if that happens it's gradual i'm always thinking about my behavior and my thought processes and how to be more productive in my life with what p eh you mean no i don't think so no i haven't be diagnosed <diag> no i haven't been xxx diagnosed with any psychological acronym <laughter> no <deep breath> uh <sigh> this weekend had a good good time with friends we had a great mm was with friends and we just were able to talk about you know some things and uh for <fo> conversation lasted for two and a half hour three hours didn't expect it to happen it was good i like talking with smart people informed people open-minded people it was a great those types of discussions are rare it's almost like running <ru> uh the high you get after running or exercising you know the endorphins it was the same thing i um <sigh> either with friends or working on my stuff my writing or exercising my heighth <laughter> i wish i were taller um i wish mm taller uh physical <phys> just physicality um i wish i didn't wear glasses mhm nothing internal mm i'm patient i've been commended for my patience by strangers um mm my relationships with my friends and my family i understand that it takes time and energy to maintain them and i take that time and energy well that's a really open general question of course you know it goes back um are you talking recently are you talking in the past <pa> um i always regret <sigh> things <th> i regret this is a little thing it's not a big thing not being more productive or efficient in the use of my time each day it's a little thing <laughter> you know so i hate wasting time i hate wasting money i hate wasting energy <deep breath> <sigh> hm that's a deep question <sigh> i'd say i was codependant ten or twenty years ago i'd say get some help get some help you're co you're co mm k sure bye

356,male,0,10,and I'm going to pull her up and if you let me know if you can see her just fine without your glasses  you know I bet it I think from this distant I think I better  okay  are you okay  yes  okay  come here from from Alhambra  the weather is really nice and everything is very familiar  sometimes there's too much congestion on the roads to too much traffic  hi I studied art and photography  I am it was so much his decision I just kept noticing that I was very interested in it  are you still working in that yes  I'm a photographer  oh I suppose.  Running a family portrait studio or some other type of photography business  I know not know I'm in it also an apartment manager keeps me tied down  it's a fair it's not the greatest because of being a department manager I do have free rent but I have to stay  they're a lot so  that part does the refrigerant part is very good  oh gosh  a most memorable experience  it's hard to say  well  I mean there's good and bad memorable experiences  oh well I guess I'm like sports success when I was in high school and a few other things that I was happy about and some art pieces I've made were memorable and  some bad things would be my father's stats right now but those are very memorable not good though  call my parents and have a lot of brothers and sisters so my family  are you to your family  a fairly close the most of them live around at La  I just a few that are from  distant my brother lives in New York and  my other brother lives in Maui  how mostly very talented  just stem more involved in technology then maybe I was or I am and they are  I think they're more of a hive mind and when I grow up SIMs like they were all hooked into social media  hi is going to walk or watch television  carplay with my computer  and I  well  there's some  there's some kind of  Injustice has that happening not big deals but for example our parking situation got worse with some new District parking text kind of upsetting and this city doesn't seem to Anna  I make any exceptions or change the rules  and also some unfair things at work sometimes happened that are  got that are upsetting  oh yeah I work in at a high Sky worked at a high school dance this last weekend and when we arrived at this site  the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it and we had to go outside  and then to get in okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor told in advance that we were to be outside it delayed our set-up time and that does wouldn't have bothered me except that on Monday morning the school called our boss and complained that we were late setting up when it when they told us to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait until we still get a complaint so that that part is upsetting in  and our work doesn't back us up at the at the office they just need to place the school to maintain the account so often when that something like that happens that means they will not send you out to work at that school again which which translated to less payroll hours for the photographers that were on that job  that's how that's how they do things  so that that is upsetting  most of the time that dust off my resume and start looking for other situation Setter yeah  a pretty good are you sure that you might die in the moment I don't really lose it but later I might prevent or something like that went on the on the location I wouldn't do that  well just today we have a tight schedule today and I have a friend that I'm sharing a car with today and we  we were arguing where to go first  10 time so we compromised and did most of her things in one of my things then after this was one of the things this over then we're going to do some of her things  no  post-traumatic stress syndrome is that what that is  no  yes  what's a 1980  yeah I think Believe It Was 1980 yeah  my father noticed some symptoms my father's is just passed away but it was the psychiatrist  well I wasn't sleeping I was laying around the house  miss waking up at  noon Sunday and I didn't have a focusrite for getting a job it wasn't clear enough I remember some job interviews that I've go to their front door and then I wouldn't go in and I think that was all I'll part of depression  yeah I thought I had a problem but I didn't know what it was  no  well and I went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that you thought that I was done it but in it and I I did get too much better place I have to watch all the time to see what's going on with depression so I think I'll have good days and bad days  I think therapy makes you see what the  like that I thought of it as a filter or wearing a as if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses you don't really you see everything through that so you have to I have to sort of try to take the glasses off for a little bit and double-check and my really receiving these things accurately  or am I seeing it through with a depressed few point when I try to look for clues about that  I think I am  slipping back a little bit. I don't do well during unemployed. I've noticed in my path in my past and right now we have a work slowdown so it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedules too wide open for for me for me personally as a depressed person I think that structure is really important to get you out of bed and you have to get somewhere in time and deal interact with people and those are all beneficial things for someone who tends to be depressed  well I don't know if it changes its a little bit I said to be focused on some things that are probably not that uplifting lightsaber but it's more negative like I  I've been sort of thinking about how soldiers in the past I don't know why but like the end during the Roman era or the ancient Greeks how it would have been like to be in the in a Frontline battle with just kind of in my opinion crude weapons and no medical help and  I don't know I set my mind seems to go there a lot I'm just thinking about that and I've been looking at it and reading books about that or video clips on YouTube  and things like that or some other kind of like terrible Doom type things like I was watching on that animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that  we're probably shouldn't dwell so much on that  I am in life in general yeah well  I think I regret not finishing College I think I had a I think I was going into depression right then it wasn't coping in my senior year very well and didn't really I didn't get out of college with a degree although I was there seven years but so that's very that's a big regret that I have  I think it would have been to  at certain points I probably should have sought therapy and also probably some outside help just with getting through finals just the logistics I had I had was an art major and I had no car so  a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth in and also to meet at away locations I think it probably would have been worth it to  do whatever it took to get a car at that time  so  well I'm Ivan tell them very patient and also I have some original original artistic ideas so  those are those are good qualities I'm very loyal and and also  and I support my friends fairly generous with them so  it's a  I said I really enjoyed it was I had a  I had a nice experience. Just photographing out a soccer game recently  that really enjoyed that so  okay  it's my pleasure thank you goodbye  I'll head to bed  let's write interesting
405,female,1,17,essential let you know and then you can let me know okay thanks  thanks  go ahead and move his cord behind you didn't get any way  hi hello  are you okay with this  yes  okay not too bad  I'm from Chicago South Side  I'm back in 1978 when I was 18  lately not much maybe once every two or three years  compared to the letter A  it's totally different you know horrible weather and  it's just a whole different atmosphere  let's see my mother had moved to Africa  I graduated from high school and I had a friend down here so I just thought well let me try la  very easy actually yeah I loved it from the moment I got off the airplane  number one the weather son is very important to me so I love the weather  I don't know just kind of a more laid-back atmosphere variety  of people  and now it's my my Homebase you know my friends that are family  that's how I like my family is here now  I guess the small hug earthquakes  traffic  just basic things like that really  I don't currently but I did throughout my life I travel quite a lot  I just seeing seeing other cultures and seeing more history and meeting people and  just fun at the fun of it as well  let's see what one trip I went to England  Ireland and Scotland and France all in you know one trip  so that was a nice variety  I guess you could say probably skiing in val de saire France  that was fun I'm glad I got to do that  that's great  do you consider yourself more shy  I'm kind of shy by Nature I've tried to grow out of being shy so I'm not fully shy but I was always an extremely shy child  but now here in Culver City this is my environment and I I guess you could say I'm not really shy and in my hometown of Culver City  I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got  to relax I like to just curl up in my bed and read my book take a nap watch TV sometimes on the couch in the living room just you know stay at home and kind of vegetate  pretty good yeah my tempers pretty level  probably with my husband  and  I can't remember the moment what it was about  okay  tell me about your relationship with you  well when you say my family do you mean  my family from childhood or my current family  okay well I guess my current family comes to mind I have two daughters and my relationships pretty good it's okay with them but they're teenagers which you know going they're going through a lot of hormones and they can be kind of bitchy and  and but I have hope that you know they'll grow out of bed and soon someday we'll have a really good relationship  and then there's the husband which  like I guess I could face soon-to-be-ex-husband hopefully soon we need to get a divorce but we're still together due to financial reasons  and yeah yeah so that that's not good relationship with the husband but  but since we have determined that we need to divorce  we don't expect anything out of each other so we don't argue as much so that's good  well  I guess our marriage  I wish I had noticed early on that  you know it was like way off from what I thought it was  how do you say oh my God  hardest decision  I guess leaving my first husband that was pretty hard  well you know we were married and I wasn't content I guess you could say and  I kind of just gave up on our relationship and now that I look back I think it's because  I want children and he would have been happy to never have any and so since I didn't have a father it was very important that I create children with someone who really wanted to be a father and so I was kind of at an age where I needed to start thinking about having children yet I was with someone who really was not into it so that I think that's one maybe the core reason why I was not content and I just felt like this marriage isn't going to work n so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not want to break up and  and I had to leave him because I just wasn't happy and that was that was very hard cuz  yeah  felt like I was hurting him which which I was him he survived he got over and now he's married with two kids but it was hard to leave him  tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from your memory  something I wish I could erase from my memory have to think about that  I'm sure there's something well  yeah there's some  I guess it'd be nice to erase from my memory a recent I'm not resend but an event in my  recent adulthood here in Culver City where one of my best friends  betrayed me by back years ago when my husband first got into real estate she and her family were growing and they really need a larger home and  we just assumed that you know that they would use my husband as their agent supposed to sell their current home current at the time and purchase a new home  and as it turned out they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent and yeah that was devastating  I don't think I've ever been betrayed like that so I wish I could erase that not cuz now you know this was back when the kids were really young  and  my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was let's say  6 Maybe  maybe five anyway her and my best friend's daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other we were pregnant together and they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we run into them in the neighborhood are they run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were just you know like two peas in a pod even those her their moms weren't talking to each other anymore so now they're 13 and 14 and they're in middle school together and they're still very connected in fact she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl and it's just a little awkward you know cuz now these girls are becoming really good friends  your friends and yet I still have this  bad memory of what her  her mom did to to me  that was about 1:10  about 8 years ago  I tried it I try to ignore it and put it out of my head which have been able to  in recent years  but obviously it still comes up  anyway that was that  not that easy I do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time I wake up and can't get back to sleep but or I finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up you know that that difficult thing  well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom and then  you know it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then I wake up again to go to the bathroom  so I guess that's the trigger as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there I don't know I think there's just too much on my mind running through my mind and the day I feel like I haven't accomplished enough during the day so  it's hard for me to just go to sleep when I'm supposed to guess  well I'm kind of used to it now so I just go on to the day probably looking looking tired and  like I'm kind of used to feeling tired I just do what I need to do and sometimes if I'm able to if I'm at home and don't have huge commitments yeah I might just like I said earlier just take a nap or something read my book watch TV whatever  lately have I been feeling  kind of down  on myself down on life  well I have this pending need for separation / divorce  I'm worried that I made a lot of mistakes with my girls now they're teenagers you know on the verge of adulthood  and so I worried that you know I did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance in their early childhood and now it's too late  like I missed out on a lot of things  and yeah I need a job I'm unemployed I don't know what I want to do with my life I know I want to do something and I just wish you know I never did finish college unfortunately because I was traveling and stuff  so I regret that extremely  and I need to get a job and be able to take care of myself cuz I need to  divorce and move on with my life so now I forget what the original question was but that's the state part of the state of Mo  no  yes  well  the first time or or or recently  the first time I guess was you know when I was in my early twenties I was just a little upset about constantly that was another breakup I had to make back then I was  in my early twenties and I needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting cuz I  you know it's hard because he didn't want to break up and I feel like I was hurting him and I didn't understand this feeling I was really upset  how did that was my first time having depression so I didn't really recognize it as depression but I went somehow I had the  knowledge or the I was able to take myself to a psychiatrist I remember I paid for her by the hour and she prescribed Xanax to just help relax me  and so I guess that helped me get through that and then I've had depression throughout the years just so you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as I guess it's usually a relationship you know  yeah so the most recent time I was diagnosed and put on meds that was probably about 2 years ago  no  money and I don't have insurance otherwise yeah I'd be happy to go to therapy anything that might help  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  last time I felt really happy  I don't know I guess maybe  when my children were born  I guess happy I just you know I always wanted children so it's nice  to have them  that's I don't know that's all I can remember of that and I guess I don't remember the good times too well I remember the bad times  something you did recently that you really enjoy  something I did that I really enjoyed  well  that's the way I am  Friday night I went to a friend's house and met up with five other girlfriends and we  we created vision boards and talked and had dinner at one of their house that was that was fun  we get to  stay in college get my degree  get therapy trying to become happy  yeah try to figure out things earlier in life  like  yeah  stay in college and and mainly I think the mean and what it all boils down to no matter what your depressed about it seems like  as soon as the saying goes in the  songs go you know it's all about money the world revolves around money in  having none that in itself is for depressing so besides relationships and different things that have happened in your life having no money as you know it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it so with that in mind I would definitely advise myself to get my college degree and to get a job and stick with it don't quit to go traveling and I'll just stick with a job sick with a company build up your seniority keep your benefits  and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of filled yeah that would have been my biggest piece of advice to myself  not much  I guess  just my daughter's you know there are two beautiful daughters and  I'm proud and glad that I was able to have children some people  aren't even able to do that you know and they try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so that's the one thing I mean I wanted five children and I always wanted a boy which I never had but I guess that's the biggest thing I can think of to be proud of  having my two daughters  I'm a very loyal  friend and person that's why when that friend betrayed me I was so devastating  yeah very loyal very  happy was I going to say I was going to say happy go lucky I don't know where that came from very I meant to say friendly and caring and  yeah I care about people  and I'm interested in people  and I care about animals as well actually that's another thing I'm proud of proud of being a vegetarian  yeah so my daughters and being vegetarian and I'm a vegetarian because I really care about feelings of other beings not only humans but animals to in  you know I don't think that animals should be tortured and live a torturous life just so we can eat them  so what was the question  remember the question  okay  you're welcome by  I did need the tissue one time so that's good  the other sister
603,male,0,4,"hello  she seems nice  boys size 10  when she says goodbye  okay  yes  all right little tired  awesome  I grew up just outside of Philadelphia and I move to Los Angeles I'm almost 5 years ago  weather for sure also I was a film major in business minor in school so I came out to be involved in entertainment  traffic smog some of the people are a little flaky but I generally like la  no quite the opposite I consider myself an extrovert  enjoy reading  get a glass of wine perhaps throw on an old movie try to get out of the apartment and maybe take a walk something like that  cruelty  people not using their people being careless or thoughtless you know not really giving consideration to other people when they knew things  usually vocalize my annoyance like unless I figured would be really inappropriate in the moment but I'll usually let somebody know as gently as possible then I'm kind of annoyed with what's going on  usually pretty good but I also you know there's like a limit point where I go past and it's like that I cannot control it really anymore so I have a long fuse but  hadabah large amount of dynamite there sometimes  I had an argument with my girlfriend recently and it was  you know we're very different communication Styles so  I guess  I was not feeling heard and she was not feeling like my response was appropriate at the time maybe  I was a film and media arts major and business minor and I actually got my masters of Business Administration it  right now I'm looking for work preferably something entertainment-related but I will take anything that will help pay the bills and let me continue living on the west side  I what I really wanted to do was to produce films so that was sort of my concentration in the film major and I did a couple of internships for production companies as an undergrad end in in my master's program and I like working with creative people and developing stories and developing projects and being the person that can go from the business and legal people to the creative people on try to make everyone happy and make some money  I tried to I mean I'm a little low on funds right now but I really enjoy traveling I drove cross-country when I moved from Philadelphia to La so I drove down the east coast to Savannah then all through the South and the Southwest I've been to England four times I've been to Continental Europe twice lot of the islands Montreal  it's only place I've been to in Canada but a lot more of the US and also Asia Africa Australia those places I've not been to yet but I'd love to go  what's a may be the first time I ever left the country first time ever went to Europe we got to take the train to Glacier Express through the Alps in Switzerland and was unbelievable with the snow and things like that and I took a lot of pictures and I don't know if it's one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen so really sticks out in my mind  I'm very close with my parents I talked with my mom on the phone probably two or three times a week I just talked to my father for Father's Day the other day and you know he always he sends me emails of news things that you found interesting or stuff that's related to  film and things like that so I'm close my sister like I have a niece and a nephew on very close with them I talked to my sister a decent amount and I always see them when I'm home for the holidays but they're all in the Philadelphia area so I'm I'm not physically around them only maybe once a year twice at the most if there's a wedding or something like that  there's been a lot  definitely my parents some of my teachers in high school and that sort of encouraged me  like my social studies microcultures Professor my one of my English teachers my phone program I did a summer internship program twice and they had one of her professors for my film  101 class like was the moderator for that so kept in touch with him as well  I like it a lot better now  my last roommate was only you somebody from the MBA program also was a year behind me and he was a terrible roommate he just moved out so I was replaced by somebody else who is  Young and nice and he has the money for rent and he has a rabbit and he's just like he's a pretty cool guy so got a decent-sized place I've got the bigger bedroom of the two and the rent is not too bad and I get to live like in Culver City Mar Vista side of town which I really enjoy so I like where I live and the rent is not bad for the neighborhood not at all but a little broke right now so I got to get back working again and and  calm down the the money situation but the living situation itself is fine  I have one roommate yes  no I have not  yes  well I mean I guess in college I was seeing a cognitive therapist for a while  but I've never medication anything like that and I kind of got away from it but  last summer but about a year ago, came back and I was being the individual counselor at school I was doing group counseling sessions and they had me on Wellbutrin  so I guess a year  yes  I had a DUI which you know all of my drinking I think was really predicated more about the depression not being able to handle that properly so that was part of it and then just the stress of school he was having problems they're having problems in my relationship and you know is that okay really low point and I felt terrible so I decided I should probably do whatever I could do in order to get better  okay  not took a leave of absence from school so that's not really available to me but I still go to like a surprise sobriety support group and you know if they're going back to school to possibility so I might John go back to doing the counseling sessions there but my health insurance runs out in like two months so I don't really have I won't really have a way to see someone unless I see Department of  health or something like that so we'll see  I definitely think that there people that are probably on medication that are not in therapy that probably should be I'd rather do therapy without medication the medication therapy that is for sure so I definitely think it's a it's a positive to  speak with something on a regular basis who is sort of removed from your life and objective about it and  don't just listen that's really the most important part is I'm coming to listen  yeah me just having dedicated time of like an hour or so you know 50 minutes whenever two or somebody gets to listen to what's going on with you and and offer some possible  guidance in that direction you know in the direction you want to go I think is always positive  and force you to be like more mindful of what actually bothering yourself when you have to vocalize in and tell them what you're feeling and try to help figure out why and what you can do about it I think that's always a good thing  that my mood has been a lot better  that was a really down black time that last oppressive. So  it's been a lot more. Like the future and what I'm doing and  the way I'm thinking about things and it supposed to just like stumbling through an existing I'm like trying to think more about what I really want to in what I believe in the things that are healthy for me and  all the stuff in the should be should been doing before but wasn't  I'm settling in for the Moon  I wasn't drinking often but when I was I was drinking to get drunk I was very very down there was some weight gain I was sleeping a lot to enjoy as much and I was worried about money I was worried about where with recommend I decided which I still am to an extent but it's not like bringing me down so much now  caught up in a down. Like a rut that I couldn't get out of  I think it was probably just  not feeling successful in the things I wanted to do and I just got swept up in the day-to-day of like oh well I don't have a job and I don't have any money and I'll try to figure it out and I'll do this interview and that's not going to really delete anything and it was just a very  you know I wasn't moving anywhere wasn't I was stuck in one spot like that  about not drinking  I'm just to let you know try to be a little bit more mindful of what I'm doing and why I'm doing it you know if I get if I end up in back in school again I'm going to definitely take up the counseling sessions again I don't know if I want to be back on medication I don't like that was good for the time frame it was in but I don't have to become everything or just good I'm trying to get back in shape now I join the gym and figure that's going to help me to but the main thing is going to be figuring what to do my life cuz I'm 30 now so I feel like I'm to get the real career started  okay just really worried about the money situation because I don't have the student loans to fall back on anymore and stuff so I'm pretty broke pens doing it again  nice  probably more positive now I would say in general I still love that The Temper switch like I'm I'm still on  the same things that bother me in the past still bother me but they're not permanently like getting me down there just I would be upset about something in the moment and need to express that and then figure out a solution or Let It Go as opposed to staying in that funk so I can more resilient definitely  yeah most of the time  like I said if I do get upset about things I'm not somebody who likes to keep things inside  but even getting Mountain Pass wouldn't really get me through them you know would be something I'd really have to slog through it would take me down for sure but now I feel a little bit more comfortable with feeling I'm feeling and getting a house and then trying to work through it  some days I do you know but it's not everyday and it's not like for no particular reason anymore I mean I may be down because I'm stressed out cuz I have such a problem that you know I need to address in the in life like my lack of funds right now and you not trying to get in bad shape and you know trying to figure out what to do with my education that I have so far and find what I want to do like that something that people should be worried about but I don't feel like it's any anxiety or anything like that as we know our sadness or fear is dominating anymore  how is your day  I'm usually okay I've been  going to bed later and wake me up later and since I've not had a job so that is something I need to watch out for cuz I really need to start waking up earlier in order to apply for things and go you don't meet people in person and try to figure something out on the job site of things but I'm I'm sleeping okay I'm not  being Sleepless or anything like that there are definitely some days where I feel like staying in bed sometimes but  physically I feel okay  that sucks I mean I've definitely I almost feel like I've liked cold symptoms 5 only get four or five hours of sleep or something like that I won't know the runny nose I'll feel a little feverish I'll be hungry at weird times like I'll just be very run down and I did I don't like that feeling at all I try to get likes every 8 hours sleep every night  probably when I was home over the holidays for the holidays I could spend half my parents and my niece and nephew and my sister and I got to see some of my old friends I got to see some of my extended family generally good feeling and is also my mom's birthday on the 27th of December so that was a fun occasion as well  I would say very intelligent very funny a little bit too intense a little bit crazy but nobody loyal also generally a  a good person a nice person  I work a lot of things in my life I've done some things like that to you I definitely regret that you know I dropped out of the first college that I went to cuz things are really going badly for me at that time and I kind of regret that I think it might have been the right thing to do but I wish I would have been nice to be able to finish school you know on time and start a career that way you know I generally try to behave the way I would feel couple sleeping at night after work but you know everybody fails it something so anytime I've lied any time I've caught something any time I've felt like I've wasted an opportunity  she's inquisitive"

my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer  you travel a lot yes  experiencing different things in different cultures  well I was stationed in Germany for three years it was a great experience  food was great averion Alps the snow the people I loved it  having a baby  well it was this the most memorable thing in my life something I never forget  great  once I'm grown handsome father-of-two  no it's actually very hard for me  not becoming angry too quickly  being able to cultivate a mind and love someone unconditionally  well I went through a lot of trauma as a child so as a parent I was very afraid for my child to go to that thing, try to protect him from it  I think it's really hard because you never really know people and what they'll do  outgoing  because if I'm in a room with people I'm usually  the first one to start talking  doesn't matter fact I have fish aquarium that's what keeps me calm  not very good  seems like everyday argue with somebody about something but yesterday  I'm a lady tried to cut line in the grocery store and I politely told her I was in line and she didn't want to move  yes it have because sometimes if people don't want to move then I feel it's my place to move them  hurting people physically  if I feel disrespected or somebody puts their hands on me I can get very ugly I don't like that about  I was pulled over by the police and they had someone with my name and they were very rude to me and I really wasn't happy with the way they treated me  how to stay calm when someone has  crossed over into my boundary  my personal space  I can't let people get too close to me if they do I eyelash out I don't want anybody in my area of  protection I guess  stay away from people  stay away from him it's hard you can't live in this world without other people sometimes I just irritate the heck out of me  being assaulted in the military something I wish I could forget  just that I felt helpless alone ashamed and angry  that's about all I want to go into it  18  very young  no  because I was assaulted in and I have a fear of  people in uniform like policemen hurting me or other military veterans hurting me when they  explode or go off or have issues of  PTSD  I can't remember  what did you do after the military  I work for the federal government  well just seemed like a normal progression the federal government gives you 10 point preference over other people for being in the military still being like a Natural Choice organization that had a book of rules and they follow them the government what government to another  are you happy  yes  well it was hard in the sense that in the military you're giving you told to handle it handle it and in the civilian world you have to go through so many hoops and different people to talk to to get something done  administration of justice  no I'm I don't work anymore  oh yeah  almost 2 years  the feeling that I was always going to be hurt that someone was out to get me I had nightmares panic attacks anxiety attacks out  outbursts of anger  I was always an emotional pain  and I always wanted to hit somebody  yes mostly disrespect what I feel is disrespect of people getting too close to me or I feel in fear of them for some reason  I can't remember the last time I had a good night sleep  what  irritable angry Moody pissed off  irrational  tired  sick of the world angry at the world  wanting to be left alone  sometimes I don't want to go on  yes  oh yeah oh yeah  well I I could recognize the trigger now when something is going to trigger me I can at least  no and act accordingly if I want to  when I found my grandchildren when they came to visit  I just so innocent and sweet and precious it was just a joy to have them around 8 make me forget about all the pain in life  planting seeds for some vegetables making a garden  I read somewhere that it's calming and soothing to work with your hands and dirt so I decided to find out  plant something and watch it grow  sitting on the beach look facing the water  thinking talking to God  wishing I was somewhere else  Kauai  Penthouse / Maui  that I could trust people  that I wouldn't lash out at them  I could sleep at night  crazy  hot headed  emotional  being in the wrong place at the wrong time  don't trust anyone be careful be wary of people and what they want from you  I said I grandchildren  I don't have a real family I don't I haven't seen my brothers in like 20-30 years I only have two brothers and I don't haven't seen them my mother's family I haven't seen in years my father's family haven't seen in

446,female,0,0,<synch> yes i'm wonderful how are you california mhm yes the weather is one of 'em uh the food um and the way uh everything is centrally located mhm the traffic the smog and um it's just gotten really really overcrowded um i wouldn't say a lot but i do try to um travel um at least once once or twice every two years um just exploring different things and being able to um have different experiences um things of that nature and you know learning new things and um just different cultures uh i like to um learn about different cultures and when you travel um you get a sense of um you know feedback from different cultures and different areas so i like that um well i just came from miami uh last year i went to miami for a week and a half and it was really nice the weather was great it was my first time going um and um the weather was wonderful the people are really nice and um it was really a great experience i went out there for um a particular event um they have um something every year um where everyone comes out from all over and uh you just kinda party and hang out and meet new people it was really fun um well from that trip i would say um swimming in the beautiful beautiful beautiful um miami beach waters was wonderful yeah it was um child development mhm well um i've always been interested in children um since i was younger um i babysat a lot so i had a lot of um experience with kids at a young age and as i grew older um i realized that it was something that i liked to do um so uh that's when i um looked into child development courses and i thought that it was something um like that i would enjoy <en> enjoy doing so um i started taking classes and um the rest is history i am yes it's been um fifteen years in august yeah my dream job i would say um to become a principal well it's something that um i've thought about doing for a while now and um i've actually just began the steps to try to get that going so um i'm gonna be back in school and i'm gonna be taking courses um so that i can make that happen because it is a dream of mine yeah thank you um it's gonna be pretty difficult um there is uh several years of schooling that i have ahead of me and um you know it's definitely gonna be a challenge but it's something that i'm up for because it is a dream job of mine so it's something that i'm willing to i'm willing to do um a little bit of both i think a little bit of both i can be shy at times um and and outgoing as well um but i think a little bit of both i would say <laughter> uh i meditate i i'm i'm a big big meditator so i love meditating i love just um reading and just having nice quiet peaceful time oh wow i'm very very good at that very good at controlling my temper i um again um a series of meditation that i do um it involves deep breathing and um just really centering yourself to where you can feel your heart beat and you can um really feel everything in your body and it really really allows you to de-stress and to control anxiety and anger and things of that nature yeah that helps me a lot oh wow it was just recently um actually unfortunately it was last week and it was with my husband and um it was about um just the way he responds sometimes to me uh it can be a little aggressive um and we're just trying to work with that because i don't respond well to aggression i totally tune out and um that's actually what happened so yeah that was it i felt very frustrated um and i actually felt angered too um but more frustrated and i felt saddened too because i don't like arguing so it was a little bit of all those emotions at one time uh <sigh> a situation which i wish i would've handled differently honestly i haven't had a situation like that in in years i've pretty much kind of um you know kind of mastered my responses um to certain um stimuli i've kinda got that down the hardest decision i've ever had to make well it was when i was sixteen years old and i became a teenage um mother i was pregnant at sixteen and um i had um a lot of pressure from family to um give my child up for adoption or to um abort and i chose life so that was that was one of the hardest decisions if not the hardest decisions to make as a sixteen year old teenage um teenager just whether i wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager or whether i wanted to embark on raising a life um when i was just a child myself so that i think was the hardest decision i had to make um well i mean um my son is almost nineteen now so it's nineteen years later and um i actually um am so glad it was one of the best things that i ever did by not choosing to abort him and choosing <choo> being pro-life pro-choice pro-life and um eh i i have not regretted the decision um that's my only child and i love him he is just a blessing he's just a blessing and i feel very special to be his mom i do yeah um no it's it's not easy uh it definitely um has it's difficulties um just as anything um but at the end of the day it is really rewarding um and you just get to see the life that you brought into the world and that you've raised become a productive citizen and go out into society and just start making their way and it's really rewarding it really is oh wow so many ways um the first way <wa> uh the first way is i actually listen to my son and i um accept his feedback even if i don't like it and i um allow him to express his self fortunately unfortunately when i was little um there was not a lot of um conversation from parent to child um it was more like we were just told you know what to do and we did it um and with my son i give him options i allow him to express his self i allow him to give me feedback um negative or positive because i feel that it's really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age and um as parents you have to be supportive and that and kind of um make sure that you nurture that um because that's kind of um the way that they develop you know and it's really really important so i'm different in um in a lot of ways in that rite thank you um <sigh> well it depends um sometimes it it really depends it depends on the time that i go to sleep it depends on the time that i woke up so it's a lot of factors um i can't just give you one answer um i would say that it varies sometimes i can go to sleep um and fall asleep right away and other times i can go to sleep and it might take awhile to actually fall asleep so it varies i've been feeling great lately i i really have been um i can't um say that like i said the last week didn't affect me um you know the argument with my husband but other than that i i've been feeling really good no i haven't no i have not you know what honestly i feel happy every day you know every day i wake up i'm happy because that is a chance for me to take advantage carpe diem seize the day so um i feel blessed every morning i wake up it's a blessing you know because i realize that some people did not wake up some people are homeless some people are going through so many situations that are really disheartening and that's not me so i feel really really blessed every day thank you um as um nurturing patient loving friendly um kind of reserved um well i wish that i had um already completed college and had my master's degree and sometimes i wish i was a little bit more knowledgeable in certain subjects and um i can change if i can change anything i would change that those two things and also i would be um a little bit more outgoing and less of an introvert you know what no regrets no regrets um you live and learn um nothing is perfect um everything that i've gone through has made me the person that i am today so i wouldn't change anything because i'm happy with the person that i am today oh <sigh> man to stay in school to stay in school and to get your education and put that first and foremost before a relationship even before your career um i really really uh would would've told myself um to stay focused and to get a great education i'm most proud of um where i've come from um as a teenage mother um being a statistic and actually changing that being on my same i've had my uh same job for fifteen years now i'm really proud of that i've been married for thirteen years i'm really proud of that happily married um to my best friend and my soulmate nothing's perfect but um he's my best friend and i love him and i'm also proud of my son um being the mother that i am and the son that i've raised i'm proud of the job that i've done and i'm um i really um applaud myself for that you're

355,male,1,10,yes  alright  I was born in Los Angeles California  I want the weather and  the fact that the people aren't so obtrusive like on the East Coast  just the the traffic in the Smoky weather  I used to I'm unemployed now so I'm rarely go anywhere  I have a BS in business with a computer option  I thought that the only place I can get a job with a business degree was in accounting or in business computer message so I took that I took business computer math adoption  I probably be  professional sports player and actor something something that you enjoy doing  I like to ride my bike I like to watch sporting events now I can't afford to go to them so I pretty much watch on TV  I like to travel but like I said I don't have money for that anymore  that's all right  people who are chicken heads they getting their nose in other people's business even if they're just strangers expect that from a family member  where are friend but you know fishing with the internet that feeds a lot of that now we know what Orwell is referring to when he spoke the big brother in 1984  I don't do much him much different than I would otherwise  and I had many temper outbursts  girl you was my aunt  and it was because she was basically  making leading statements trying to trap me into saying something about a relative and if you don't know I'd me greatly  I'm kind of on the outs with my parents  the black sheep  I mean my Mom's done the most to help me she's done a lot you know more than anybody by far  well I mean she's just me one time when I was in like 15 I went with a friend of mine to see the Crosby Stills Nash and Young concert at the Forum and she has seven kids and she pick me up at the Sizzler is right across the street from the Forum at 11 at night and I couldn't imagine the others had to do that day that she agreed to do that but she did  oh probably  going down to the cape at the end of a Baja Peninsula and Cabo San Lucas or photograph in the bridal veil falls in Yosemite  I was by the two most majestic see sites I've ever seen  it was when I could afford to travel  no  no  I was diagnosed with depression after a hospital visit in April of 2011 and I took some Lexapro but I stopped after one day I didn't want to do it anymore  no  because I didn't feel it was help I feel I was becoming a zombie  yeah  depressed about not having a job for over two years I lost my job in October 2010 and except for you nose job like this which I'm fortunate to get just neon daily things focus groups like that I haven't worked  thank you  Ashley when you're 56 years old  well just get the general feeling of hopelessness  I get out of my bicycle out of walkthrough bikes 4 hours a day spent about 2 hours each  yeah it's good to me  very easy  cuz now I'm old when I was young I couldn't sleep more than 4 6 hours a night  cuz I'm Restless  are you triggered by something no  but now that I'm old I am I sleep much more easily  I pray before I go to sleep and that that's it that's when I can't have any trouble sleeping I just pray beside different prayers like the Lord's prayer Hail Mary stuff like that and I'm leaving to fall off to sleep  I don't know probably  you have any news Civic remembrances  I love that you know it was when I had money to spend I know that and when I had to have a job to have money to spend so it's probably 15 years ago  well  I haven't really enjoyed anything that last week I did a made $75 on that job with the the county basically it was an emergency preparedness exercise they were running for their personnel and the enlisted people to play  the basically the relatives of people who'd been in this fall bombing at the Staple Center and we you know ask question sign up unit on giving information on missing you no relatives and basically I was provided by the county and they said they went to a routine in downtown LA  that's not hard it was just a just a routine we had to follow we had to act like we were actually missing somebody and had to give this ethics of their characteristics height weight excetera  I don't have a best friend  I'm a very bright I'm a perfectionist at my job  I bet about it  I got a business degree and I'm never been a motivated person I went to school I went to  2 state colleges in two junior colleges to need that in so I believe that was probably the most significant contribution that I made to my  anatomiya I guess self-esteem you might say I had something to hang on the wall  yeah I regret you know alienating family members  I would have  basically not been so impetuous and left left jobs think thinking that you know I can always get another one and not you know basically blow-off jobs I could probably work at one of the employers that I used to work for now  Fade Out and locations but I burn Bridges there so that's not possible  thank you  hasta luego
432,male,0,1,<synch> i'm cool fine new york yep eh about six months six months ago nicer pace uh photography job it's a good move mm uh i love the weather cool people relax easy to talk to uh nice environment mm crime when you go through some sections yeah i've done my share uh the ability to <sigh> capture events be a part of it be a part of exciting things like um olympics games festivals uh special shows yeah meet new people yeah which one mm canada uh it was nice uh very refreshing mm clean environment uh the people seemed very very lighthearted but you're able to do serious work i love the landscape uh i think it was riding onboard an amtrak train yeah uh liberated photography uh i think i'm doing it you know i really <re> i i really believe i'm doing it um not very difficult you know uh um not at least not for me because i think i have some natural inclination for it uh and um i connect well with people i'm more shy but i'm forced to be outgoing because i you know you can't really get anything done being shy but given a choice i'd rather be um you know a little more pulled back <laughter> uh until i you know i i i feel like just the closest a safe path to go so that kinda curtails with my spirit of adventure sometimes i think an example hmm well an example of what exactly you mean what aspect okay well example like uh traveling sometimes you wanna go to a particular place and it's uh something great happening there even though it's a great place but it's not such a cool place to go like take for instance like boston i used to go there a lot um now you know everybody i talk to is like a little bit nervous whether they should go there <laughter> you know to do you know uh um xxx you know have a great time you know i think it's because of all the disturbance that just happened kinda you know throws you off track a bit make you rethink um is that a good getaway spot still right now something like that you know mhm mm uh me i huh i take walks i call up a friend we have tea or something you know uh i think i pretty much gotten that under control mm eh uh it was probably something silly in a work situation that last about five minutes and oh pretty much haven't fought again i don't really dwell on negative things too much uh um i don't have any regrets right now mm i really can't think of anything right off the top the hardest decision i've ever had to make was uh not hiring a good friend uh for a job that you know they weren't qualified for that's hard uh because you have to explain to them that it's not the friendship you're hiring it's their competence my father uh he just uh taught me how to you know uh overcome uh difficulties when i was growing up and how important it was to not give up uh and be able to see the bright side of any situation you face because it goes away you know if you hold in there long enough and i i found that to be true so mhm um it's okay except <exce> except for some of my uh my distant siblings you know i don't see as often as i can mm yeah uh just you know when you when you travel quite a bit you just don't see people 'cause <laughter> they're not always there you know uh it's nothing like mhm yeah mhm uh well you know i'm i'm i get pretty excited if i'm working on something or developing something so i tend to overlook the time sometime but other than that you know when i when i'm out i'm out that's it well uh i guess i'll be a little bit uh uh try and figure out how i'm gonna get sleep you know as soon as i can to make up xxx but um uh i i try not to be uh grumpy or anything i just probably feel a little bit tired mm i feel okay now uh changes like what mm well i i i see a more hopeful future you know and i see uh i see a lot of new things unfolding i mean from that perspective yes no never uh i feel okay now uh i went to a great party last week that was really cool yeah well it was like on a rooftop uh and a a lot to really uh nice people who are basically in the same kind of uh mindset uh pursuing the same type of uh uh goals and it was uh quite inspiring actually and i got a lot of information and a lot of good connections were made mm awesome guy awesome absolutely awesome my ideal weekend is uh cooking my own food relaxing you know and if i'm in the mood for company you know i have friends and uh you know uh family members join me well i'd kinda like to put on more weight sometime but that doesn't seem to work i eat like crazy and nothing happen mm well you know i i think people in general sometime uh uh misread <mis> misread you you know if you kinda like uh if you look different or you're in <i> in a different type of a if a different set of things make you uh excited or you're into a different way of thinking um people tend to misjudge you you know and that used to make make me really be upset sometime but um yeah i'm i've kinda figured it out and i'm pretty much over that you know so i see it as their loss and not mine you know if they didn't get to know me you know that's hey maybe they don't need to and it doesn't really bother me i've kinda worked those things out in time you know yeah uh my best qualities probably um uh listening i think <mumbling> and uh maybe just uh talking uh you know on a conversational level uh yeah sometime people tend to burden me with everything they got because of that but uh you know i guess is that's probably one of the things that come with the turf so when i <clears throat> when i see too much of that i just uh pull back uh uh go for your dream believe in what you're doing don't let anyone discourage you and you'll be okay and that's the way i feel now that it's uh kind of evolved itself most proud of um i think my um my my my kinda spiritual relationship you know and my my my settleness about not being too too anxious about about <bout> things that go on around me and being able to see that you know there are no mistakes that really happen and you shouldn't really uh never allow yourself to be defeated i'm i'm proud to be able to have arrived at that point in my my my thinking my framework uh that i think that saved me a lot of uh problems that could've been uh differently <mumbles> very good questions uh i bye bye

409,male,0,10,everything right this is you want to go alone  okay  yeah  okay well  what's up just want to see what they look like to I like to try to be aware of like how I'm answering which means about her it would be okay  okay  okay alright  oh I see okay I got you okay  what was she say okay okay I got you then alright thank you  hi  are you okay with this sure  doing okay  I'm from my la  yeah  I like the weather I like the sports teams like the entertainment  it's pretty much the same you're wrong as far as the weather could be good and could be bad you don't get to get all four seasons so it's kind of like a mixed bag and I guess that means I'm kind of used to it by now so be nice to explore other areas I will draw my life having too much traveling so it's a little bit of a kind of a Readiness to it but overall it's okay  okay  I like the computer programming and operations but that's going back to the 70 so it's technology has changed a lot as you can tell the last 40 years that's right that's why I chose my major yeah  I know it's kind of this kind of inquisitive it to get to use your mind you was like your brand-new something you know very novel back in the in the old days you know I'm back in the seventies now it's turned into computers but back then I was sort of like something very unique you didn't see too many computers around back then and then programming so it's kind of been to the logical together solving a particular problem he'll come up with a step-by-step Solutions on I guess I'll sort of the analytical Ennis of the year the problem  I know I kind of FaceTime still use computers but I haven't gotten I've been have been in programming for a long time  well I kind of got into an another area kind of divorce Intuit diversion to another area my life this is going back to the late 70s I kind of took another turn and then by the time I got back into it was I kind of got into another field so I never really pursued it to the degree that I wanted to  what's your dream job wow that's a good question I never thought about that ironically actually pretty simple this point in time this is kind of like a little bit depressed and then I am at this point it kind of just wanted to kind of just do a nice relaxing job but I do want it somewhat of a challenge but I don't want to have to like do too much too much thinking it's almost said what I was back in the in the old days you know I just want a nice comfortable relaxing job but I can feel fulfillment on but I don't want to chance of a situation kind of point in my life I just want a nice relaxing job  yeah  oh I would say well the most part shot because once I get going I could be outgoing but I'm shy to begin with and then I X I can listen up and be more outgoing and spend I can take it to the extreme arm talking too much like once upon gates open at the kind of open up too much so I have to like back off now but overall it's a I'm kind of shy as it is a general demeanor  okay  sometime  turn on the fish tank screensaver  yeah  well I listen to music by watch TV  just was what it would do to relax a stressful situation so I can have them stay relaxed Elsa talk to my friends to I'll be around an area about kind of a comfort area where I feel safe I can just dialogue with people so kind of gets me out of my think about my own problems I'm having a kind of just you know focus on being in the moment with my friends and acquaintances  I'm pretty good I don't really have a temper problem it takes a lot to get me to to explode I think when I was in my younger days I think it was a bit more  had a little bit slight bit of Tampa never had a really bad temper but tempers not really an issue I have to be pretty mellow easy-going  wow that's a good question I'm not sure to be honest  I don't think about that for a long time and to be honest I can't come with an answer on that not really part of my repertoire nothing comes to mind. My head  well  well don't say anything on the way back and made some bad and bad Investments back about 10 years ago  how's more  Charlie like what I'm looking for more trusting of people like that people in like them I thought were expert in their field and I inherited some money I was little bit careless with it and I just kind of had a Vibe you know that nothing would go wrong kind of little bit of night-night tivity and unfortunately some bad financial decision is kind of put me in a bad position for the rest of my life and fortunately he got because of a medical conditions I have talking to rebounding you don't make it all up so I was saved mainly financial and investment decisions that I really regret  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to me  wow  that's a tough one  I can't think everything about my head  okay  well I don't really have too much family left the only one I have is my it just me and my uncle and we could we communicate on a regular basis he look but he lives in Clearwater Florida so long we were okay but  he's like it isn't he's in his eighties and I was young my my 50 so we can we do we have kind of small talk and he's kind of concerned about my well-being but it's kind of somewhat of a on a shell of a really deep and that he's got his own problems so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation  other than him it's really there's not really anybody else to have I did that part makes me a little depressed cuz I don't really feel I have anybody I can really count on a really confide in  it is challenging I don't know why but I do have a medical condition something that might be part of the problem and I have a little bit of BPH so I'll be out of town for the restroom and answer your question to make a long story short it is challenging to get a good night's wake up feeling a little bit tired aching but it is difficult  how deep is feeling lately  well I've been feeling okay I mean  be kind of feeling now actually trying to address issues that I haven't taken responsibility for  but I feel a bit of calmness as of late  have you ever been tagged  no  well I just say yes. The questionnaire and I'm not positive if it was technically diagnosed with it I did take a Venus call the mmph the Minnesota multi-faceted personality something of whether this is going back about six months ago they were asking me questions about my memory but then they also got two questions about my my well being psychologically too and I think some of the answers to the advice that I see a psychologist or psychiatrist I didn't follow that up on that because the philosophical differences but I think I might have a mild case of depression  well you don't like I said I'm just kind of like kind of goat along in life and I'm doing okay but you know highlights passed me by so I haven't really fulfilled my my goal was kind of like alone I'd like to have a girlfriend I don't have a girlfriend so that's kind of tell me who I feel I can get close to and I'm not really in my life right now so what is a certainty I'm having some kind of financial uncertainties so overall not doing as good as I'd like to  okay  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  that's a good one really happy  let me think about that a minute  well actually it wasn't that long ago actually I want you  okay I know that one actually I think I'm going to answer I hope that old lady she was at a trade show it was a Anaheim with natural products Expo so it's pretty nice we we had some nice meals afterwards there's a lot of exhibitors giving out really nice samples it was an Anaheim some kind of got a chance to get away from LA and  met some interesting people are they were very outgoing they're willing to like having experienced their product or service and I was around people that I work with who I got to socialize with old was pretty happy back then and it was about a month ago  yeah that was  best friend and I really have a best friend but  I would say  I don't know technically I really don't have a best friend so she heard me answer that so I can't really come with an answer to be honest  I like to be conscientious and I do have flaws Mary but I think the overall unconscientious I try to be honest for the most part I'm on the major issues I might you know they would have likewise or you know I'm not perfect I'm not going to come to the serious stuff I tend to be pretty honest I'm a hard worker. Good work ethic  can you be pretty calm for the most part  play regret  what can you elaborate on that  well  I just well just overall I regret them  not be a little more assertive in my earlier  earlier life if I put myself in this position is going to go back to my financial decisions that was sort of that sort of like my albatross in my life I made some bad decisions and unfortunately the kind of pay the price for now so I kind of like sort of like living sort of a popper existence right now which is kind of kind of depressing so I would say that's part of what I regret most of all  advice would you give yourself 10  well I would say to really you don't analyze kind of go with what you really feel  I think I was going with other people's opinion other people's advice I was kind of going away from my basic beingness you don't like the way I really felt like I'd make you aggressive investing which if it turned out good it would be like for like when the lot I would have been well off for the rest of my life but unfortunately it went the opposite way too many eggs in a basket so I kind of regret it going with my gut feeling and let other people influence me and I could by Nature I'm a conservative person so I should really do more conservative Investments another is my life at 10 to be more conservative but I kind of made some aggressive financial decision so that's pretty much  can a local doctor that area as far as what I regret  wow  that's interesting I've been doing a lot of working weekends so well I do like to be profitable to do something where I can actually you don't make money that's sort of like my bread and butter time could you trade shows but I'm not doing that then I'm like maybe watch some men you know I like to go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game go to a movie go with some friends so just going to kick back but my main primary primary focus will be on earning earning money on the weekends  huh  that's interesting  what's prerogative  I would say that I live by and large all of the wholesome life I would say I never got myself into any kind of really bad  bad advice you know I  I love the pretty hoe salsa my wife I said I'll probably I don't really proud but as far as I stay the course as far as not going down any real deep to speak  okay  my pleasure  that's pretty interesting is it improve your technology on a lot more like you're talking to a live person Siri  it was kind of a little bit more Academy can tell us like a more like a like a video game this looks more like a real person communicates like  return for not trying to deal with her but it was some other guys and I think I know what it was but it was a little bit more  I can't reveal all the details but this is see no more comfortable more natural  yeah
617,male,1,12,wow  okay  I broke it  not so good  okay  all right questions and then when she's done she should say goodbye and you can press this button  okay  okay  should be how good  yes  I'm doing pretty good  originally I was born in Denver Colorado  I like the beach sunshine  pretty girls  the ocean  other things  smog  excess amount of people in traffic that can be dealt with  I would like to travel more  seeing new things and and learning perhaps if you culture or something  oh okay I when I was younger I went to Europe and just did the backpacking thing  backpack around Europe for a little while and it was it was real fun  I'm probably just being in the military with some friends and stuff like that  why have a degree in film and I'm finishing a degree in or for business as well  now I look for work I'm trying to do some sort of entrepreneurial effort now as I finish my business degree  it'd probably be to own my own company that's kind of why I want some sort of entrepreneurial effort to push push for with some sort of interesting product or service that I'd be working in  I would say middle of the road a little bit shy and at times can be takes a while to warm up  are you cautious to meet someone new and then from there  I kind of see where to go from there I guess  my family they still live in Colorado their interesting people and good as well as I talk to him  pray couple times a week they're good people I have one brother and he has a couple of kids and that he's married as well  that's a good question lately I've been trying to get a daily amount of exercise like jogging or riding a bike and recently got a bike  something like that on a daily  effort  for the most part pretty good I try to if I have an outburst or if I'm being irritable I try to stay away from people who didn't like to go off on people they didn't do anything wrong  Edward change the topic in my mind I guess  what gets me in trouble would be more I avoid things and it kind of builds up and becomes worse  and that kind of gets the trouble and  basically just in a relationship with a girlfriend  to be honest with that it remember exactly what it was about it's just probably in one of us is being irritable and me and  going from there or it's probably a lot to do with the money as well I don't have the best financial security at this point  that's a good question  oh my I guess I I do Harbor a little bit of guilt from the military as far as getting out and people are still in I suppose I know that's it's not for me anymore  only thing well I I used to work at for a friend and I invested into his company  and the economy went down was a construction accessory company basically and kind of movement down and we lost most of our money like most of the folks around America and that pretty much  it was a good and bad thing is you got to look at it from a good good perspective but it definitely put it myself into talespin I financially and couldn't really do anything about it almost was homeless for a little while  but I I wish I wouldn't have invested into the company and just move forward and  perhaps going to school like I'm going anyway  I have  I was 21  I wanted a change in life I wanted some more real-world experiences  answer my country and also the added benefits of going to school or nice I didn't have  much Financial capabilities at that time and I wanted to change to get out of my current situation and that was the best way out I thought  are you happy  yeah yeah I'm very happy I join the military I appreciate it now more that I mount and understanding kind of what I supposed war was about it is definitely changing people and myself as well  yeah I did a tour both in Iraq and Afghanistan as well  see I thought at first it was very easy and then I came to understand he was very difficult  just because I was adjusting from military life and still having that in my head and not until now I realize that I probably just a few months ago  to Reno reintegrate myself a little bit better and choose civilian life which it's it's actually it's actually pretty difficult  no problem  movie think I when I got out of the military  versus I'd I invested like I said into my friend's company and we started that little business we're doing well for the while working and then lost all of our money  and then I traveled for a while at a gender stand now is obviously some other issues but I traveled all over America good working and went to school in New York for a little while  lived in a few different states and came back to California where I'm finishing school finally  living the dream  that's a good question I would say  well it didn't and instills you with with very good I think since of  sense of character and strength and you know I think there's a lot of good qualities that the military are military puts a new people but at the same time it puts a lot of bad qualities  as well because you need some sort of edge or something that you need on on am almost daily basis and if you don't get that then in a lot of guys do you know turn into drinking or drugs just cuz you can't get that same Edge  and that really that can really either hurt or benefit you  I've been feeling okay I've had a bit of a sinus issues lately but I've been feeling okay  actually I have my my thoughts I used to really have scattered thoughts  and  I would say I'm starting to get a little bit better Clarity which is good  taking a lot of different therapy and stuff like that and it it's actually helped  it's it's very as I can't really let the tough part for me is the schedule because that's if I'm not tired you don't sleep you just lay there  it's Hit or Miss really some nights I can sleep pretty well some nights I have to wait till I'm exhausted  and I don't like doing pills  pills are bad I didn't understand that but it's basically just can't sleep because either you're on my mind is always thinking about something or something I feel that I have to do but yet I'm not doing anything that's not true trying to always do something or do you have some some troubling dreams at times but that doesn't really negate me from sleeping and wakes me up is what it does because it can't be that the dream that you remember versus the one that you don't  when I don't sleep well  perhaps your ability and anxiety definitely go up I I definitely get I have a tendency to get a lot of headaches  and not sleeping very well definitely puts that into the mix  I have  not that I know of no  I I don't know I try to feel happiness on a daily basis I guess what you could answer but I'm not certain  I'll say my my dad's been a very positive influence  that's a good question charismatic her funguy pretty tough  a good worker  I'd say I really enjoyed jogging  the other day on the beach  something that I am most proud of I would say I'm actually an online Minister as well and I married my brother and his wife and that was a pretty proud experience  all good  she said goodbye  okay
370,male,0,0,"when she's done  hi I'm Ali thanks for coming in today I was created to talk to people and it's safe  and please  are you okay  yeah  I'm doing pretty okay thanks for asking how are you  I'm from here in La I grew up in the San Fernando Valley  yeah  well I like the the diversity of people the different kinds of food you can eat I like the outdoor opportunities I grew up close to the hills so I did a lot of hiking and camping is pretty close by have gone snowboarding I like it the familiarity I think you know it's it's a big city and you know I'm pretty familiar with the having lived here for so long that I haven't said like that too  I'm probably the number one thing that everybody says I don't like Gothic that don't like being stuck in traffic I don't like  the long commute Stephen Nina for short distances  danonino gets really hot in the summer a time so you know that I could stand it being a little slightly cooler when I gets to its peak Peak heat but that's fine  well my dream job that's a great question I asked  I think my dream job would probably be you know maybe being able to travel and somehow make money off of that profit off it you know maybe gainful Employment Office traveling but it's almost an unrealistic dream since I don't know if I would actually want to do that but if  if I had to pick some kind of dream existence he of traveling getting paid to travel and meeting new people trying new things and being able to make a living out of that would be pretty fun  well I like like a mention what I like by the way I like trying different kinds of food different Cuisine so I think trying authentic cuisines in different places and meeting different kinds of people sing different ways of life would be that is what I like about traveling I like experiencing new things I think that'd be nice so you know despite the fact I said I'd like the familiarity of La there's also funded discovering you think so I think when I travel that's that's what I like to do just checking things out  I would like to be you know if I could make a living doing that that be great  one of my trips okay well let's see the the last trip I took  I think of what one one more exciting trip  well my my family is from Eastern Europe so one of the trips I took with my parents when I was fourteen was I went to Austria Hungary and Romania and you know getting to see some of those old guy been a few times before but I was when I was little so I don't really have too much primary plus I didn't really process things quite the same as when I was kind of more of age so I got to see you know my family is old you know Hometown you know that we have a family like tomb so I got to see that than just these old buildings and just a different way of life I really like that you know seeing my parents old friends you know and so that was pretty funny was very different I was like really my first time being taken away from my my home environment do you know I left them know the school year so is just like going from no Suburban America to traveling around kind of you know taking these old trains and Sandy's castles and he's old like hundreds of the year old Townsend  I don't know if it was for everyone you know I don't know it would be great for everybody by I really enjoyed it  but it's the best  oh that's that's a good question I do I probably one of the things I do is either turn on like a rerun of a sitcom I used to watch the office a lot so I kind of know when that's on so I'll turn that on you know just kind of zone out a little bit too you know if you like it characters in and hearing the jokes that are still funny for some reason or maybe like eating some kind of comfort food you know I try not to eat too much fast food at all but like in and out I really like going there so if I have to unwind once every few months maybe I'll do that or I really like to read especially like I'll read the day's events you know that that really relax with me for some reason even if it's reading about something some conflict going on some of the World II Soul I'll read the headlines and I really like to know what's going on that kind of centers me so I really enjoy that that's the way I do to relax  I would say I'm pretty great at it at all though I don't I think my nature makes it pretty easy pranks that pretty easy I don't I don't get very upset easily at all so it's not much of a challenge to control my temper at  yeah I don't really have anger issues that it's difficult for me to get angry so I don't I don't I don't really have much trouble with that at all  last time I argued with somebody was probably  I don't even know I a mean small disagreement see no I might have had with family or friends about things but just a full-on argument I got I can't even remember it's been years I did I don't really argue too much I try to avoid conflict as much as possible in my in my personal life I don't really see anything to be gained by and I kind of naturally repel away from it so I don't have much to say about arguing  what's something you feel guilty about  I feel guilty about I would say that you know something sometimes I don't really  I feel like I may be having made the most of my potential yet in life I think that I could definitely do more despite the fact I work a lot I feel like I there's always more opportunity out there that they were missing I feel like you know sometimes down time I feel a little bit guilty about that because there's always something that I could be doing that I'm not even if it's just putting away the laundry that that's been I took out of the dryer that's been sitting there or  running late I really don't like running late although it happens more than I'd like to write I don't know why I feel guilty about that I don't like keeping people wait waiting because it makes it feel like you're my time is not more valuable than theirs which is obviously not true  tell me about new bed or something that you wish you could erase from your memory  nothing immediately comes to mind I well the last car accident I got into it was a few years ago I guess I wish it hadn't happened. I wish I could erase it from my memory but I ate was driving in rush-hour traffic and you know it I thought the cars in front of me where we're going you know at least for a little Mia 10-15 feet but it turns out that that stops so you know slow rear end collision but it was still very important I was just you know I just felt like I was paying attention one second and the next second you know I was just like reaching for something on the lights in the passenger seat and then I ate I smacked into the car in front of me in  I wish I had a theft and absolutely I know it's a minor thing but it was just really unfortunate the timing of it was very bad enough for me financially any of the people I got into an accident while we were fine but I was you know they they didn't ask for anything beyond repairing the damage is but that it was just a horrible timing so I wished I hadn't happened  but that sucks it did suck I've over now but I suck  okay  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep well I'm a pretty good sleeper although I naturally wired to be up later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job allows me fortunate pretty flexible schedule but on the same token I wish I could wear like hardwired to go to sleep earlier because I just I wind up staying up till 1 or 2 every night and it's just too late you know even though I can get a full eight hours or whatnot of sleep it's not always at night time you know half of my sleep is like in the head of early daylight hours I wish I were more able to sleep. Go to sleep at like 10 or 11 and then sleep in or wake up earlier as opposed to  going to sleep later and waking up later  I'm pretty feeling pretty good. I've been I have no complaints physically and you health-wise I feel good you're my relationships with my my family and friends are good  everything is great so far I had absolutely no no real complaints as far as how I'm feeling. Myself or anything like that  no no I've been fairly consistent with my behavior in my thoughts I think that  everything is been been pretty okay pretty said he no no nothing traumatic nothing kind of resurfacing for the past nothing of the sort has this happened there is happening  no  no  well I think there's plenty of things everybody regrets yeah yeah there's there's plenty of things  in my life yeah like I said I I do regret you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days he know I there's a pretty of time in my early twenties where I I didn't work for a while I just I hung out with a lot of friends yeah I guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us work we just you know we we got high everyday or it seemed like every day I don't know it was just this is kind of like a throwaway. Of my life  advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  I would say that  it's important to  210 gauge with the world I think I I think I kind of dropped off in the world a little bit I think it's also I would say that it's important to  recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what what kind of potential do you know if you try tivities that you can expect from the people you surround yourself with I think that I would say also that kind of try to focus on what I wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking while you know things will work out which eventually they do but I think that you know there's a bit of lost time with that approach is kind of fatalistic and I think that I would say you know just try to concentrate you know you know not not everyone works on the same schedule in life is not a race but I would say that it was it important to have a goal in mind or some kind of you no idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kind of waiting and thinking of things will fall into place  tell me about a time when someone made you  well I I  I guess some people I I don't especially  take it even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason I think that at least myself I sort of have things figured out although I am not sure I'm wrong about that so I think just maybe in terms of like a group work. Done professionally or academically you know when when some of my work is kind of picked apart or were scrutinized I'd I don't deal well with that and I had taken more personally than I should  show me about a year-and-a-half ago I was working on a research project at work and somebody with much less those three of us working on something and then they brought in another pair of eyes just to go over it in those somebody just out of God College you know  went over what we have done and you know it's just kind of rewording things and it seems just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of of changing things and I kind of took first offense to that just because I thought I had a lot more experience and more education and it was unnecessary that you know I thought the whole thing was a waste of time and you know I just  I didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to attend this earlier we do all our work or or even to not not to redo it but to 2 edited or to proofread I guessed it to make any kind of you know qualitative changes I I just thought that it was a really bad idea and I thought that you know I should have viewed it this way but I thought that the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know it was kind of like an affront to us would work on it on this project but you know it wasn't our call  most memorable experiences  I guess the first thing that comes to mind is one of my the first real trip I took by myself I took the the Amtrak to to New Mexico and I was out there exploring things for about 10 days on my own so that was kind of the longest. Time up till that point and I was in my 23 maybe at the time that I had really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone I was in parts of New Mexico where there's no cell phone reception at the time  it is very memorable because I was on it on my own I feel like I was really you know exposed to the things I wouldn't have seen if I had to had traveling companions it was a lot of fun  tell me about the last time you felt  I live a very happy recently I didn't for that I'm getting married in a few months I got engaged on Labor Day 2012 this whole process Casino album a meeting some of them we'd be kind of progressed very quickly realize where we would recognize her we were so I've been a pretty happy state the past it's been 11 months now but yeah so I think that the day we got engaged and then we we shared it with our family I think those have been very happy times New Years was happy you know happy. Of my life right now so  yeah thank you  what sort of  sets of humor that maybe not everybody gets I'd say also  you know helpful, I'm relaxed Maybe  intelligent you know likes to recycle I know that's so suck that they would say  hey what else I think that best friend might say that I like animals I've always had dogs and cats so they might describe me as a people person I mean an animal person sees me I also you know fairly easygoing you know flexible with with plans  I'd say one of the most proud of in my life  well I'm pretty happy with the level of Education I've gotten I'm also going back and starting the fall I'm starting a Ph.D program so I'm happy about that happy about you know breaking so my bad habits from the past that I'd say if I'm proud of anything it's that you don't have a strong faith relationship I go to church off and I'm very happy about that I don't have pride is the right word but my relationship to my family and friends are all very good I'd say maybe the fact that it's a lot different than my life is a lot different than it was about 10 years ago you know that the change I'm I'm happy and proud of that  no problem have a good day thank you  goodbye  so"
364,male,0,0,therapy like this instead of fun  with a live Human to put all the NFL teams out of business  because Provost  I don't think it's good sometimes I think people might talk to a stranger better or more open than to  if it's someone that might just go buy a couple questions might judge you or for opinions of it's a virtual human being in might be a little less biased also  and nothing's great idea  we could sit at home and do this instead of a going into an office  now she is  that she can have it  thank you very much  how do I know what does she going to say the end of session or okay  I'm a sheep but also I'm going to actually have to go grab a tissue  oh I'm sorry  not at all  sorry about that  hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today  creative  I'm not a therapist  are you okay with this p.m.  I feel pretty good I'm wide awake I had any good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee and I have an easy day today so I am just going to chat with you then I'm going to the gym and run some errands so I plan on having a nice day today  originally  I was born and raised in Los Angeles and I'm one of the few locals from around here and I went to school away and but I'm one of the few days that are actually in Los Angeles  yes I am  I like the weather having a vacation house in another state that I found to be too hot and humid in Florida I love the weather here I like the cultural diversity I like the familiarity I like that beaches Basswood like the chest an hour and a half away one can go to the desert Palm Springs Palm Desert but also another hour and a half two hours away and go to Arrowhead or Big Bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that and I think it's a great place to live  well maybe some of the things I don't like that I like your say California in general say like the high tax rate which the state tax rate is up to 13 points something out which is going to Chase business out of here also the regulations I'm a small business owner so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have been their businesses to taxes Arizona Nevada excetera some the other western states that are less regulated and that's a good problem here and California  it really does muscle don't understand it but it's also  yeah besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't see that but it's a big tax on the social service system and that's what make our taxes so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of  so that's how you know but people don't seem to want to really deal with do you want that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high in people are moving out of state  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I enjoy traveling got into 66 countries  and I don't travel as much as I used to but I've traveled quite a bit and I just learned a couple of languages and I surf I'm sorry  I didn't really understand that your question  when you said like what I don't think you understood what I said but I'll just go back and  I've been all through Europe Eastern Europe Asia South America North Africa and I enjoy that and I enjoy the warm climates now especially where you can go and relax where is warm water to surf the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up and I also like to exercise Surf and do yoga and workout and I try to eat healthy and that's a big part of my life  I love to hear  what are my favorite trips of all time where they used to when I was younger see how many countries I can do in a relatively short. Of time saying it three or four weeks span but about 10 years ago we actually went to Paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though I've been there about 10 times we got to know the city really well which was great really live like a local and rent a small flat cooked and did our own shopping but really haven't been there so many times it really never stayed for more than 3 or 4 days it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and I really get to learn the city and it was fun even though I grew up in La I grew up taking French which there wasn't a big Spanish speaking population when I when I was younger my mother insisted that all of us kids take French in the Spanish would have been a lot more valuable but I took French all through elementary junior high  Tienda high school so it's nice to practice my French even though I don't remember a whole lot and even though it's Dad speaking French with the French you know my accent isn't the greatest ever a couple of sentences they start talking English to me  so that was out  I have a few different degrees  so I was a naval science major as an undergraduate  and that was fun and I also have a master's degree in economics  and I've degree in crisis management  I found them interesting and  just something that I wanted to do where I went to college I went to the Naval Academy I'm up there to play sports and I found it real interesting being from Southern California going to school on Maryland and I originally want to be a doctor but  which start going to school for a little bit you change your mind excetera so  are you still working  I'm actually in the wholesale business now or Wholesale Distributors of furniture products and it was a family business but I went to work there a number of years ago when am I grandfathered recently father passed away so I was going to run up a tirol family business and it's pretty interesting I like it having grown up around it but different other jobs out of the past  actually probably my dream job I enjoy cooking and staying at home and  I would probably like to stay home and raise kids because I do have one daughter and you didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as I would have liked but I think I would be better than say a lot of women I know that want to work I actually like cooking and hanging out around the house and taking care of kids you know that I like doing it always on a part-time basis but it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and not do that having pretty much worked for most of my life so I'll probably never happen but it sounds something that to me it would be fun  do you consider yourself more shy  I think I am generally more reserved and shy with strangers but when I get to know someone or feel comfortable I think I'm more of an extrovert More Strangers might think I'm more introverted but I think when I feel comfortable with certain people and I don't know what it is I can meet a stranger and be totally confident or people I might have known for years either from a personal or business situation  and be more introverted I just go with the Dynamics but I think my outward manifestations to be a little more shy generally and he's like use the term reserved  okay  sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got  oh wow that's a great idea I used to have that on one of my guy with several computers at home and I bet you speak one of my screen savers as well when I need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events exercise will there be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or Tony the beach yeah maybe going surfing of the weather is warm I don't start from cold weather anymore cuz it makes  because Mike a brain freeze you not surf you know if over 30 years and exercise helps me relax the best or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the TV I find relaxing  I like that screensaver I used to have that on one of my screensavers at home  that was that was it but it's one of the things that took me a number of years to master that were my relaxation skills apart and have them the best of my twenties but over the years I think I've gotten better  I think that's a key thing I think as we mature as we learn how to do that I wish I don't have to do that and be a little more hadn't had those skills earlier  I like to think I'm pretty good I think I'm a lot better as well as that as I've aged you know I I am more likely to think before I speak now whereas a 20 years ago is more likely act before I thought so my dad said more things that I would ever attend situation where their personal or a work situation but I've never had a violent temper but I would have a temper where fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and really reflecting on it I think I'm a lot better at that now that I was saying my teens or twenties  I think a lot of that comes out here or there is maturity  oh wow you know I really had an argument with anybody in Somali what I would consider it traditional  argument probably my ex-wife a number of years ago. We had an argument basically just over my daughter and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just basically one of the reasons we weren't married our values are so different just our ideas of parenting and just  outlook on life was so different nothing that cost us the butt heads but it's just I know if I caught an argument but it was more of just one of those let's agree to disagree but heads some  I felt like I was talking to a wall and I actually felt more mad at myself that I should have learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone else folder with them that's the kind of discussions that people usually have but you're not really thinking about that because sometimes or younger work looking at boy how does that I look great on paper to her and she look great on paper to me I'm pretty easy-going I have different ideas on raising children have she did and it was more not that she was wrong and I was right not that I was right she was wrong it's just how we raise our different views and we never really  discuss those things but it was really just fundamental reasons on why we butted heads weren't really a good match whereas other things look good on paper to both of us  tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differ  find recently my father passed away recently  thank you and  really because in our religion you plan a funeral very quickly United typically within a couple of days and I really only invited very very close friends and family members has more or less sort of in charge of it my dad is were married but it was sort of not really up to it so I took care of it and I wish I had invited a  I kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would have liked to have come to the service and been known about it so I really know he invited because just before the time pressure really just a handful of people but now it's times past I wish I invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends you have 10 or 20 points is of people he knew you from business or over the years and I really just an even distant family members I really just told after the fact I really didn't invite him this I was under a time pressure but I could have easily have done it via email or turn to call everybody personally but I wish that some things people have expressed a little  they're upset with me one my other family members through it all back at me all you can tell me till after the fact that you know someone serve it passed so they all through the media so I was more or less  doing this I wish I did that differently but I did the best I could at the time so I'm not really mad at myself that's something I probably should have been more prepared for all service it was something that was coming was inevitable so  my boss my parents are recently  deceased in the last couple of years and had a brother that I've three are brothers one of who passed away in December  and we're not super close like I always like I look at other families we were just never liked that Norman Rockwell painting because we're all so different and I have a closer relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family not that it's strange but I wish it was more like boy one of those families I got together every Sunday and had dinner and all that we just never did that because we're all also a different  I understand. That's just how it is but you know the strangers most of us how to use family everybody's great you know but I think every family has their own sort of  nope I thought probably I could have had it before from  some other events in my life and I just wasn't sure I've had been to some therapy in the past just from  you know I was in the military and I was never really sure if that that's exactly what it was but I think I function  pretty well but I just wasn't sure that I had been nesin therapy and counseling over the years  I should decide to enlist in the military didn't enlist as an officer  I want one of the service academies  17 I started after high school and went to a service Academy  so it's more Prestige this isn't enlisting it's the hardware I want to sell her to school in America to get into  I was but same age as everybody else and went there  did you ever see KO  we did  1983  just basically wasn't anything intense was just weird just around since we were just we weren't allowed to carry ammunition we were just our positions were just shelled at the time and poison gas was sprayed on us  so that was a I was at wasn't anything too too intense with lot you know he just fits the service I was in the training is way more intense in any actual combat situation  that's because they train you will like you practice harder than you play ignorant ass like he play football practice harder than you actually playing the game the same with  you know if you're in a combat unit  all right baby more patriotic having grown up  in California where people were from all over the country and I got to meet us most of see my friends who grew up in an affluent Los Angeles like I did never really went out and met a lot of American some people from different backgrounds and ended up becoming  just more patriotic a deeper sense of pride in the country what is really don't grow for that in Southern California where someone in Texas or Kentucky or Tennessee or Georgia North Dakota South Dakota Montana  it was up with that kind of Pride so I thought it was getting and unlike somebody my friends that they don't know what he's there's any life between Malibu and Manhattan  I went to graduate I was still in the reserves but I went to graduate school  and I got to graduate degrees and I'm at work in private Enterprise didn't care for it that I join the fire department As A Firefighter and paramedic for a number of years and  then after I got divorced it was hard to do the custody situation with my daughter so into work in the family business that's pretty much my career in a nutshell  at first it was difficult because I just had such a bearing in my butt from the way I walked I talked and I guess I was an officer you were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time it was harder to be a while to be able to come back to Los Angeles  I guess I was just so so different I think I handled better than most I have a stronger personality  so but it's a great experience  it all depends if I exercise regularly and I don't eat too late and things are going well in my life I generally sleep pretty well  even though I might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night now but I generally sleep do I sleep pretty well  I feel pretty good lately you know I've been like anybody else more periods of blowing your life but the last few months I feel great pretty much  no not really I seem like I seem a little happier and more content lately  okay  have you been diagnosed with depression I thought maybe in the past said you have a family history of it and you know it wasn't anything real to debilitating and I wasn't able to really function on my own but I was concerned with it and sought counseling  I do I was really against in the past and until after I went and then I wish I went more save during my  my marriage or the course of my life now I think it's very useful however in the past I was one of those I grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous and it was a waste of money excetera but I think it's a useful tool that you're open to it  it's just a question. I want to just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about life relationships and sometimes it's good talking things out with a professional even though I wouldn't see somebody like you and realize I'd prefer some of his older than I am a little more life experience and some of his may be younger  so but yeah I think it's a useful tool and I really did a 180 switch on that  I don't know now I'm started taking a break from it but I'm not against it if I have some issues I want to bounce off I give someone that I can go to  I think it's nice you know they really if you got to someone who's good and it could have been that few different people at start a therapist shot they really don't tell you what to think which I think it's great you know that's the passage to help you talk through your your thoughts  and you're feeling to let you decide yourself but bring a little Clarity to the situation that's why I like  talking to someone with a lot more life experience  and I generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff to take to a man  so but it's  I think it's a useful tool I got some good ideas and was able to slice bouncing some things off totally some of these unbiased is not in your day-to-day life instead of talking to a romantic partner or close friends whenever you but sometimes bouncing the people off of stranger is good  last time you felt really high  all this morning I know this this is weird them clearly someone and I'd say this is a joke to my friends and family and Associates it clearly haven't having an easy day today cuz I knew we had a nice weather and I have much of errands to run and I clearly have seasonal affective disorder but I woke up so happy today when I know it's going to be 80 degrees out and when the weather is nice I'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather is dark and blue and rainy and called where I always I know that time so but I'm just what I woke up really happy today but then it's going to be a nice day  I look forward to feeling the Sun so  most of my friends I'm sort of a renaissance man I know a little bit about a lot of subjects I'm too smart for my own good  and I'm off  I know a lot a lot a lot a lot of pretty things I'm pretty rational I'm very resourceful people always call me when they have issues and I'll talk them through it or resource won't tell them where to go whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy new car or  you know I'm great with medical diagnosis  and people say I'm a lot of fun and fun to be with and  I also have I don't have a lot of Grey areas people either really like me or don't like me to meet the things are pretty much black and white  I am what I am I don't BS  yeah I'm the opposite of a politician  I don't tell people what they want to hear to be rude not read anybody but call things as I see him that's pretty much  really said you everything tactfully  okay I like to think I do  I wish Ice Bobby spent more time with my parents before they passed but it's busy I probably wish I was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was young  but just one of the three typical  really to think things through a little bit more be a little less impulsive or pretended to be more impulsive when I was younger than I am now  I think that's that's it and it would look at things in the long-term instead of looking and things in the short-term you make decisions or choices  what are you most proud of in your life  I'm proud of my daughter she's nice young lady I am proud of my public service I've never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service there very few people like me who did it or is that the background and education that I did but I like public service  and some proud of all that I'm proud of all the certificates I have hanging on my walls and how many degrees it's sort of like trophies I'm proud that they be able to stay in really good physical shape over the years and  knock would maintain good health  it was nice meeting you  bye-bye thank you  how was I  what does old-fashioned you know like Mom
453,male,1,17,hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today yes  Los Angeles  convenience convenience  people the crowd  traffic  people that lack of respect  locally originally  meeting old people I love talking old people  I work a lot with my elders in my reservation and other reservations here in California and I spend a lot of time with her with the elders I talked with them and they helped me out of  Target are good stories  going in the mountains and seeing waterfalls then no one else is saying except for my people and I was the most beautiful thing I think I found  it depends on the situation if I'm if somebody comes to me looking for me to help them I take control it if I need help with its I work at asking for help so it depends on the situation  I Garden  and I think  very good.  3 days ago it was about communication and the lack of communication on the other person's part and I needed them to communicate better so that way I could understand and they didn't communicate so we had an argument and I got to settle  I felt I'm caught off guard because this is an individual that I spend pretty much almost every minute of my day with and to not be told what was going on in this person's head and then to have a situation arise and I was kept out I didn't like that  I got a pass  probably lack of time spent with my grandparents  just wanted on you regret that you didn't miss time with spend time with me  I want thing I truly wish I could remember I was I was a professional athlete and what time I have party till like 4 in the morning and then I had did my event at like 10 in the morning and I was my captain and I'm very smile team  that's one thing I truly believe that  are the professional fighter soon  yeah I'm not party. About other people besides myself  I studied massage therapy and Nursing degree  a lot of it's just been on job education  I'm very  I'll get to my own injuries I just going through the therapy process and believing in people and seeing how it worked and I decided to do that I wanted to help people too  are you happy  oh yeah  yes  I want to paint that's all I want to do is just paint  I have two sons and it's time for me to the move on and they're older and they can take care of themselves now so many leaving the area where my sons are sweetheart  the reflection of you  play reflection of you a mind you so much about yourself Who You Are  consistency even when you're sick  I don't assume my kids are right around by listen to him first and then make my decisions after that and I try not to come from an emotional hiding place but I think logically and I put myself in their place before I do it we discuss we communicate happy in my family cuz that's the only way we get along with each other through communication  communicate  my family is severed pretty much so my family my relationship with my family on the reservation is very tight and the rest of the family were all fragmented scattered around the Southwest so it's not very tight at all  I have too many to count  start with my uncle my uncle was like my dad. Me to go away  he watched out for me he told me he taught me hard work at a very young age he also taught me to protect my family  Tommy honor. Me Love  it's a good man  how easy is it for you to get a good night  I don't lie ever had a good night sleep in years so I have to get broken sleep  are dreams the dreams you come through real  get up and go to the bathroom and go back to sleep  my years of fighting and just got up to me  reserved  reserved and I try to find things to distract my brain to think of different ways of doing things  I got rid of TV about 8 months ago so I got rid of that distraction so what I do now is ready to paint a garden or cleaning house washing dishes or get out the walk that's nothing to do a lot of walking out is  anxiety anxious  my anxieties  habits good I have techniques to bring myself down  nothing new  out of the normal  yes  3 years ago around 3  insomnia issues  it was about  2 years ago around there to look it over two years ago I was released from therapy  off the therapist Release Me  what I noticed is I still deal with pictures and emotions  what would I do is now if I really practice hard at taking care of myself and then getting to those places to things that  strike me give me anxious or excited or angry I learn how to work out of it and realize it's not real it's not real  that's just the emotion it's not real so these are the things like no manches and I tell myself and this is really helped me a lot from therapy because it taught me that those emotions and pictures truly aren't real  and that's the therapies helped a lot that mean it's just a change my world  if  around the same time as the PTSD  after years ago  in my dreams when I dream I do  last night  I just dreaming of fighting and then in preparing fighters to fight I wasn't nothing to I build up anxiety dreaming about preparing fighters to fight and then stepping in front of thousands of people and then I always end up fighting in my dreams so it's always what gets me scared in all my dreams is that I should have made the move and finish the fight and I didn't  and so builds anxiety and stressing me that I tend to act out in my sleep  I was real like I was there right like I smell taste feel everything their house there  on this morning driving here talking to my girlfriend  trustworthy  he loves me I love him he's more best friends  a 02 change  I can recall  okay  I got it  just not spending time with my grandparents and in  I think they today issues maybe you know a couple here there that I should have went to the store first or something like that but I mean it's nothing like that  quit thinking you know it all  my loyalty  my trustworthiness  the new art project yesterday  nice  where is Santa Barbara from the film some rocks and some old rock song Someone that made by loving just threw a dump old rocks out of the way and it went through the pile of rocks and I found the soul rock that was in the middle of it and then took a home and now I'm doing art piece on it and for me it was like the thing was totally forgotten about was just considered a rock and now they're sure you'll be sitting in my grand kids table and let's just give me a call like that  what are you most proud of in your life  start starting something that I'm so bad at  then I don't think there's no way I can be good at it and all sudden I get to be better at it so I don't even have to think about it just so good at it that way I could just touch it and feel it and then I think about it these are the things I'm proud of like I like that I like that  accomplishment I guess you can say  her her left clavicle needs adjustment  her clavicle set tired makes it look like she's been in a car accident and she's like this sheet her left shoulder is up higher and it's question so you're off and it's drawing my attention to that so I don't know if you guys noticed that to the other part of it too is the hand motions that she does some of the hand motions are very aggressive in it and wakes it was very distracting in the beginning because she was like  fast moving like my therapist cuz we working with the PTSD issues he that he did everything slowly cuz I said off on quick trigger movements and so like with her hand movements like that. Like this talkin it was distracting in the beginning but besides that everything is just like it's pretty amazing computer but it's and you feel comfortable that is a good thing  yeah yeah
377,female,1,16,"so when she's finished I'll just wait for a little more buttons not working I'm pleased  are you okay  yeah go ahead  okay  I grew up in Wisconsin and I lived in Colorado for a bit and then they lived overseas for a little while and then I move to California  I moved here at the end of June of last year so I guess it's been 8 months something like that  at the most probably twice a year  Well my own town is all of 5,000 people and there are a lot of cows and barns and Farms so the opposite of LA  good question I have always wanted to live in California so but I had to living in in the Central Coast  and I just have been coming down to La like once a month for different business and that working and personal development stuff so yeah things were changing in Santa Cruz for me that client I had who is really the main like Financial  Main Financial Source I had that relationship ended so I was totally free to move and I thought well I guess I'll give Ally a try and see what happens so  I give it a shot and here I am  no not at all very very big city  I lived in Dublin in Ireland was it which is also a big city but you know European cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy and  yeah so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging and  I'm not much of a world Explorer. I love to travel I love it I live in Ireland and I traveled by the Morocco and I was in Costa Rica on my spend some time in Mexico so yeah  I love meeting new people experiencing new cultures and like also not just seeing what's different but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go  I want to hear about one of your trips  sure well  I guess trying to think which is my favorite time of night there's amazing things about Morocco and Costa Rica both but Morocco's incredible it was like 12 days and we went to three different locations we went up in the atlas mountains are beautiful and  yeah it's a really really cool culture that was fun  my trip to Ireland I actually visited there which is why I decided to move there so my most memorable moment of that trip probably dozens but the first most memorable moment of that trip was being in a bison and leaving Dublin and going to sound to the countryside and seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is time is everyone is these pictures of Ireland or you know you see in films and it's green and Lush and gorgeous but you actually get there and experienced it it's like the pictures don't do it justice so incredible  I might have an undergrad degree in English and psychology and a psychology minor and I have a master's degree in women's studies  no I use my English in Psychology I work in marketing Communications so actually do sales so yeah the psychology definitely comes in to comes into play and so does my  I guess my undergrad degree in English but really like I took that on and and created something out of it because most people who get an English degree just teach and I I wasn't wanting to teach  what made you decide to do  too cuz I'm not clear on the question  okay  my job  wow  yeah my dream job is  being a  a motivational speaker and trainer and coach  I'm in traveling the world doing that and impacting people's lives and really contributing to people  my relationships pretty good actually I  I just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who would not she was sporadic I saw her sporadically growing up I lived my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and they had two kids together so I grew up and I consider them like the family I grew up with so but I got in communication with my biological mother  last May and we've been  clear things up and have been in communication since then  well not sure what you mean but if you're referring to being communication with my birth mother is very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and they do not just the future but in the present moment with her so yeah  I'm shy  time to relax I do a number of things I like to do yoga and I don't have the money for it right now I love to dance I love to read I love to go to the ocean and spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions that really retarded is my battery actually probably more than anything else  I like to be with friends I love arts and trying new restaurants  yeah all those things are  both relaxing and I guess they're relaxing in the sense that I feel connected to the people in my life and today experiences of my life so  yeah  how are you at controlling your temper  depends if I'm driving not very good but otherwise I'm pretty good at it  last night I argued with somebody probably would have to be  Ono is with the LA times that the newspaper delivery  yeah that was the last time  tell me about  yeah the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that I take care of it didn't show up and I didn't realize that it wasn't there until  I'm late I don't know afternoon I think early afternoon and then I called them and they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after 10:30 in the morning which is absurd to me when they made a mistake in the first place so I mean for service at and it would pay for it for every day so I'm yeah I was just really irritated and then I found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so amazing Ricky L E X I was angry with people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me I was pretty frustrated  Noel there quite a few of those  I think about 1  the other day I had a phone call  and I'm going to coaching program and  it was from one of the coaches in the program and she was explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls cuz we have one particular coach we work with and then she called to tell me that I was going to have another coaching call with  someone who's not my couch and that hasn't been explained to me it's part of the program so it's in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my God I have all these people I have to be accountable to and you know I have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just  so yeah I wasn't  I was an angry I was just I just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and I talked it out with her and we got through it but  yeah I could have  certainly just been okay with what for was being asked of me in the at that time and would have made the call go a lot smoother  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make  large decision while there's been a few  why is moving to Ireland was probably the hardest decision now it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was challenging  that was the hardest decision was the first time that I  moved away from my family I was 28 and I decided to I chose to move to Colorado and that's a pretty tough decision at that point my family had been within an hour's Drive of where I lived an hour hour-and-a-half and now they're going to be a 12-hour drive away or a plane right away so that was challenging  oh lots of things  I love Colorado Colorado is beautiful beautiful state and the weather is so much better than Wisconsin and at the time I was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor outdoor community in Colorado so they were a lot more people who were in my age group and or single that was another factor and we're interested in the things I was interested in so Colorado to seem like a really natural fit hell yeah and then I found a job that I liked the pay was atrocious but I found some work that was really rewarding and that all came together just move  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  I was totally unrelated question  relatively easily it just depends on like what time I go to sleep if I'm out and I don't get home until 11:30 then  and having to go to bed late and I wake up feeling tired like I feel today but generally I can sleep through the night I've had some pretty anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks but even so even when I wake up from those are five-star from those I still can fall back to sleep relatively easily  I'm sure they are I mean I'm in another transition state and moving out of  out of the house that I live in right now or take care of an elderly woman  yeah and I just I have to find  the financial means to support me in doing that and it's and she creates a lot of anxiety just didn't her state of being anxious exhausting and I'd really depressing  living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing I've ever done and I would never ever choose to do it again if I honestly if I knew what I was getting into I don't think I would have said yes to the situation  I feel trapped and helpless like this nothing I can  no way out of the situation that I'm in no matter what I do it doesn't get any better I did I don't know I'm not getting any kind of work that I want to do and my money's not working at all  so yeah I feel pretty crappy  I have in the past year  oh a long time I was 15 I think 14 so it was over 20 years ago  are you suicidal  you feel down  oh yeah I fell down  I don't actually now  well I originally stopped  with my therapist because we had completed I mean we had worked on what needed to be worked on and I was no longer depressed and and then I began therapy again later on think I wish it was in my early thirties and then I we ended that because I moved to Ireland so  yeah I'm in depending on the therapist and sitting on your intention like I I don't go into therapy thinking I'm going to be in this therapeutic relationship for the next 10 years I think that's ridiculous  I think you going to therapy to work on a specific problem and I have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board you can see things that you can't see and  we not work through that situation and come up with  a strategy for notches that not just in creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies and tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever  tell me about the last time you got  can I feel really happy  Zoe Sierra go  no that's not true it was when I  saw my biological mother which was last May  my best qualities  I'm very strong  very strong-willed  I  very supportive and loving and nurturing I'm easy to be around I'm intelligence  and  is there anything you regret  I don't think so  now  what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  don't take life too seriously  how ideal weekend, spend some time at the beach and spend some time with friends  either going out at night you know to a movie or just going out to  a club or bar somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together maybe go dancing after and Sundays I usually go to  and then I have brunch with friends and  may I go home and Sunday night and get ready for the next day so  I am most proud of  a few things that mean I've moved to places that I wanted to move to and so I've done things that have really spoken to me and if meant something been dear to my heart to actually  achieve those those  goals are those  yeah I've done things that I wanted to do like move to Ireland and move to California  okay"
425,female,0,6,all right  okay thank you  and please  are you okay with  yes  I'm okay doing a little tired and worried  well I am looking for a place to live and I don't have a job right now so things are you sore a little  shaky for me  these days  where do you live I'm staying with my son in Venice  it's pretty good but both of us need to have our own space so that's why I'm looking for another place to live  originally from New York but I've been in California since the early 70s  yeah  I moved to LA because I had been living in Portland Oregon and I was getting tired of the weather up there and my son was down here so it seems like a good place to be  how easy was it for you to get used to living in LA  and it wasn't too hard I I met people right away and I just really liked it here so it was it was easy to connect with people  the weather is number one for most people I love being near the ocean I like the energy I like if they are like the artistic culture  well everybody loves the traffic and me loves the weather and hates the traffic so I kind of feel I feel the same way sometimes it gets a little wearing that it's so busy and the fact that it's so expensive makes it difficult  I see what you mean  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer  you travel a lot  I know not as much as I'd like if if I had more and more income more friends I would travel more  I mostly have been  may I travel as let's say so my longest trips it was out of the country was to Mexico and I traveled drove down with a friend down to Oaxaca and the whole trip we took about about 4 weeks going down and back from the Bay Area  yeah that was a fun trip  well we've been working together on the census and if she had made that trip a few times and invited me to come along with her  from that trip I would say we were in Oaxaca for a Day of the Dead so it was celebrating Day of the Dead with the family in the little village that we were staying in at everybody in the village makes an altar in their house for their loved ones who have passed away and  they also decorate clean and decorate the graves so there were lots of flowers and it was just it was neat to be there and be with that family celebrating that  I studied I was in the liberal arts program but I didn't stay stay only stay in school for in college for a couple of years but I was most interested in Liberal Arts and Humanities  dream job  my dream job would be personal assisting somebody who was in a creative field and getting to travel and go to events with them  how hot is it  it's hard to break into I'm starting now very minimally with somebody who I'm doing more of a volunteer work with and I'm I'm working on building up some of my skills so that I can be doing more of that  I'm fairly I'm kind of a friendly introvert so you know I have no trouble meeting people I don't hold back and you know I just am not like shy at parties I'll go up and talk to people but I am over all kind of introverted so  I prefer one-on-one then big groups  I like to watch I like to watch improvement shows like HGTV I like to watch  I agree model shows and and see Transformations or watch movies or read I play some Solitaire on my my Kindle Fire  okay  how are you at controlling your temper  I don't usually realize I'm mad until later it doesn't really come up and I just tend not to have the kind of life where  those situations arise us sometime soon of sometimes on the road I get a little annoyed I don't get annoyed so much I like when people cut me off or anything like that but when people are deliberately rude and and you know honk for no reason or  you know it when they get angry because maybe I've done something inadvertent nail cut them off by mistake and you know like they get really angry then that makes me angry and return  When was the last time you argue with  yeah I like I said I don't really get into arguments  I did have I was with a friend the other day and  she got annoyed with me because she felt like I was correcting her  so it wasn't really an argument but she  I had said something that she heard as a correction while it was a correction and she got angry  well then I felt criticized and I felt I felt vulnerable I wasn't it was it was pretty uncomfortable  well in that situation I didn't I didn't have to correct her  so  I think that's something I'm starting to look at in myself is my need to be right  so in general that's I'm trying to to catch that and just let people  make mistakes with without my telling them about it  I don't know  that's Tuff  I can't know that I've had that much trouble making decisions  well  hard for me to decide to put my cat to sleep when he was sick  oh it was and I had to give up a cat  and I was moving once and and that was difficult to  well in the case of the first cat the one that was sick  I decided when the vet said that he thought it was the Humane decision  and with cat I had to give up I didn't I  didn't really decide I was moving to a place that where I couldn't take her  and so I thought I found somebody who could take her  say that stuff  I don't really have that the erasing from the memory part  there's nothing I really wish I could erase from my memory  trying to think of something that I've done that I  wish I hadn't done  oh okay I remember something they were there was a time when I was I was in a class at Junior College it was a film class and I was I was the one who was after we we went out and did a little film project  and we're supposed to bring it back into class the next week I was the one who had the film and through different just things that were happening in my life right now and never went back to the school but I never brought them to film back so all the work they have done I had to do over again and I still feel bad about that  but it's pretty easy sometimes I wake up in the early morning hours and and have trouble going back to sleep but that's not very often  how to concealing lately  I've been feeling kind of tired and low-level depressed like not feeling a lot of options  no  yes I have  oh there were two times there was once back in like 1970  290 about 1972 or 3 and then  another time  oh so then would that have been in bed 16 years ago  just feeling like there wasn't  you know feeling the feeling that things weren't going to change  if I didn't get some help and that if I  I didn't have to let you know that maybe if I got some medication that would help me  and the short-term  I'm not going to therapy right now  Travis moving around alot finances there wasn't really feeling the need starting to think it might be an option again  I feel like therapy can be useful  well when I went to therapy  it was helpful to have somebody who listened and could also  offer impartial suggestions for helping me to improve the way I was feeling  I was on the beach last weekend was beautiful day and I was sitting in the sun and just relaxing I had my notebook can I was doing some writing and I felt very happy and content  I'm kind and compassionate and I'm a good listener  and I'm intelligent and I have five good ideas  well I wish that  sometimes I wish I was a harder worker I'm not really willing to take  low-wage jobs even though  I need work so I just don't feel like I'm willing to do anything  and  I wish I could act as I said I had good ideas I have good ideas and I'm good at the the onset but I'm not really good on the follow-through so a lot of those ideas get started but then I don't take them the distance that's probably the the thing I'd like to change my myself the most  10 or 20 years ago I'd give myself the advice to go back to school and get my degree  finish my education  and be willing to  to work a regular job and two  to start putting money away for my retirement  what are you most proud of in your life  proud of my children and I am proud of the friendships I have and I'm proud that  that  people people do admire me and value my opinion  goodbye goodbye  okay  okay  thank you
453,male,1,17,hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today yes  Los Angeles  convenience convenience  people the crowd  traffic  people that lack of respect  locally originally  meeting old people I love talking old people  I work a lot with my elders in my reservation and other reservations here in California and I spend a lot of time with her with the elders I talked with them and they helped me out of  Target are good stories  going in the mountains and seeing waterfalls then no one else is saying except for my people and I was the most beautiful thing I think I found  it depends on the situation if I'm if somebody comes to me looking for me to help them I take control it if I need help with its I work at asking for help so it depends on the situation  I Garden  and I think  very good.  3 days ago it was about communication and the lack of communication on the other person's part and I needed them to communicate better so that way I could understand and they didn't communicate so we had an argument and I got to settle  I felt I'm caught off guard because this is an individual that I spend pretty much almost every minute of my day with and to not be told what was going on in this person's head and then to have a situation arise and I was kept out I didn't like that  I got a pass  probably lack of time spent with my grandparents  just wanted on you regret that you didn't miss time with spend time with me  I want thing I truly wish I could remember I was I was a professional athlete and what time I have party till like 4 in the morning and then I had did my event at like 10 in the morning and I was my captain and I'm very smile team  that's one thing I truly believe that  are the professional fighter soon  yeah I'm not party. About other people besides myself  I studied massage therapy and Nursing degree  a lot of it's just been on job education  I'm very  I'll get to my own injuries I just going through the therapy process and believing in people and seeing how it worked and I decided to do that I wanted to help people too  are you happy  oh yeah  yes  I want to paint that's all I want to do is just paint  I have two sons and it's time for me to the move on and they're older and they can take care of themselves now so many leaving the area where my sons are sweetheart  the reflection of you  play reflection of you a mind you so much about yourself Who You Are  consistency even when you're sick  I don't assume my kids are right around by listen to him first and then make my decisions after that and I try not to come from an emotional hiding place but I think logically and I put myself in their place before I do it we discuss we communicate happy in my family cuz that's the only way we get along with each other through communication  communicate  my family is severed pretty much so my family my relationship with my family on the reservation is very tight and the rest of the family were all fragmented scattered around the Southwest so it's not very tight at all  I have too many to count  start with my uncle my uncle was like my dad. Me to go away  he watched out for me he told me he taught me hard work at a very young age he also taught me to protect my family  Tommy honor. Me Love  it's a good man  how easy is it for you to get a good night  I don't lie ever had a good night sleep in years so I have to get broken sleep  are dreams the dreams you come through real  get up and go to the bathroom and go back to sleep  my years of fighting and just got up to me  reserved  reserved and I try to find things to distract my brain to think of different ways of doing things  I got rid of TV about 8 months ago so I got rid of that distraction so what I do now is ready to paint a garden or cleaning house washing dishes or get out the walk that's nothing to do a lot of walking out is  anxiety anxious  my anxieties  habits good I have techniques to bring myself down  nothing new  out of the normal  yes  3 years ago around 3  insomnia issues  it was about  2 years ago around there to look it over two years ago I was released from therapy  off the therapist Release Me  what I noticed is I still deal with pictures and emotions  what would I do is now if I really practice hard at taking care of myself and then getting to those places to things that  strike me give me anxious or excited or angry I learn how to work out of it and realize it's not real it's not real  that's just the emotion it's not real so these are the things like no manches and I tell myself and this is really helped me a lot from therapy because it taught me that those emotions and pictures truly aren't real  and that's the therapies helped a lot that mean it's just a change my world  if  around the same time as the PTSD  after years ago  in my dreams when I dream I do  last night  I just dreaming of fighting and then in preparing fighters to fight I wasn't nothing to I build up anxiety dreaming about preparing fighters to fight and then stepping in front of thousands of people and then I always end up fighting in my dreams so it's always what gets me scared in all my dreams is that I should have made the move and finish the fight and I didn't  and so builds anxiety and stressing me that I tend to act out in my sleep  I was real like I was there right like I smell taste feel everything their house there  on this morning driving here talking to my girlfriend  trustworthy  he loves me I love him he's more best friends  a 02 change  I can recall  okay  I got it  just not spending time with my grandparents and in  I think they today issues maybe you know a couple here there that I should have went to the store first or something like that but I mean it's nothing like that  quit thinking you know it all  my loyalty  my trustworthiness  the new art project yesterday  nice  where is Santa Barbara from the film some rocks and some old rock song Someone that made by loving just threw a dump old rocks out of the way and it went through the pile of rocks and I found the soul rock that was in the middle of it and then took a home and now I'm doing art piece on it and for me it was like the thing was totally forgotten about was just considered a rock and now they're sure you'll be sitting in my grand kids table and let's just give me a call like that  what are you most proud of in your life  start starting something that I'm so bad at  then I don't think there's no way I can be good at it and all sudden I get to be better at it so I don't even have to think about it just so good at it that way I could just touch it and feel it and then I think about it these are the things I'm proud of like I like that I like that  accomplishment I guess you can say  her her left clavicle needs adjustment  her clavicle set tired makes it look like she's been in a car accident and she's like this sheet her left shoulder is up higher and it's question so you're off and it's drawing my attention to that so I don't know if you guys noticed that to the other part of it too is the hand motions that she does some of the hand motions are very aggressive in it and wakes it was very distracting in the beginning because she was like  fast moving like my therapist cuz we working with the PTSD issues he that he did everything slowly cuz I said off on quick trigger movements and so like with her hand movements like that. Like this talkin it was distracting in the beginning but besides that everything is just like it's pretty amazing computer but it's and you feel comfortable that is a good thing  yeah yeah
350,female,1,11,yes  i'm doing fine thank you  originally i'm from well i was born in mississippi so i'm from gulfport mississippi  yes  i didn't have a choice i was a child i moved here with my parents  <laughter> uh when i was two years old  <laughter> yes i was i was a toddler  yes i like to travel and i travel a lot  um being around new environments and new people uh different things  <cough> um well one of my favorite trips was visiting africa in i think two thousand six i visited uh west africa and that was a great trip for me it was a medical mission where we volunteered and gave medical assistance to people  a friend of mine uh was actually involved and she talked to me about getting involved so i went in with her and it went from there so i don't know i made the decision that way   i am i am happy i did that it's something i'll never forget <laughter>  i studied english and education so that i could teach high school students  uh not currently no well right now i um tutor privately for a private tutoring company and looking to get back into the classroom working as a teacher  mhm wow anything that uh combines teaching traveling and writing would be a dream job for me so yeah anything that combines those three items so teaching has the closest outcome to that    um  occasionally yes <laughter> um <clears throat>  i don't know i guess in comparison to others that are considered outgoing um and and a lot of people have said i seem reserved or kinda introverted i don't know   mm well  i don't know i read um i just started meditation  mm try to breathe and calm down <laughter> yeah  some things that make me really mad um  mistreatment of children  abuse of children  um try to figure out what's annoying me usually and then go from there uh if i can control not being annoyed like ultimately i control that whether or not i'm annoyed so try to figure out what the problem is and then go from there and not be annoyed <laughter> if i can help it all  oh i'm fine i can totally <to> in at controlling my temper i think so i don't have a yeah    the last time i argued with someone  was um  i don't know maybe a couple of days ago and it was about um it was about um a smell they had on their clothes but i thought smelled like perfume and they said it did not so <laughter>  yeah  <laughter> this is cool uh i think i'm very close to my family we're a pretty close knit family talk every day um see each other almost every day  there've been a lot of positive um influences in my life i would say my aunt and uh definitely my mother have all been positive influences  well um i look i look <l> i uh <clears throat> look up to my aunt um i think she's positive i look up to her  because obviously we grew up with very similar backgrounds came from very similar neighborhoods and areas and she's very successful um despite the types of things that we've gone through as children  and um she doesn't let her past define her future uh my mom's overcome so many obstacles as well um she had some challenges with her health but she still tries to be optimistic and she's still tries to   you know overcome these things and just still live our life despite some physical barriers that she might have so i look up to people who are able to  you know not allow their current situation to dictate their future because anything is possible   no i have not  no i have  um well i was diagnosed um within the last um year and uh then again most recently within the last three months  well um fear and just not knowing what to do with uh some of the things i was feeling and not knowing um you know why i couldn't stop feeling the way i was feeling  there were a lot of symptoms um  um you know mostly i uh i gained a lot of weight um i couldn't sleep a lot and then sometimes i could sleep too much <laughter> um  felt sad sometimes  like i wanted to cry a lot  i've been feeling okay um there are days yeah um i don't know every day is different so i mean today i feel fine but like i said everything is differently lately i've been feeling um more like i can be involved <inv> involved in my own life and like i wanna get   out and do more things  um  no no it's no no i haven't  not any different from before what i was experiencing before  no  mm well mm i was receiving um  uh i guess psychotherapy and um i don't know a lot of things happened i moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother and i just kinda  got more involved in taking care of other people instead of myself for a while  uh sometimes  i do  yes it is it's kinda difficult um i either have a hard time falling asleep or a hard time staying asleep i'm sure it is i just don't know what it is as of yet because i you know <sniffle> usually it's um thoughts continual thoughts running through my mind that either keep me up or make it hard for me to uh go asleep or make it hard for me to stay asleep mhm um journal sometimes uh that might help if i can write some things down and get it out that helps other than that i don't you know i haven't found any really great ways of coping  it tired <laughter>  yeah mostly uh tired um kinda confused  i don't know for the most part i feel happy it's just um   last time i felt really happy was i guess over the holidays  uh i don't know i guess the just being around uh family and friends just the holiday season i guess in general that's just a happy time for me and seeing people i haven't seen in a while um that's about it  how would my best friend describe me probably as um  quiet sometimes cautious talkative sometimes um tenacious  um i don't know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for uh some of my accomplishments and they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because i'm caring and compassionate or um easy to talk to um that i remind them of a of <o> feel like a sister to them  <laughter>  um everyone has regrets i'm sure yeah i regret stuff  to just  relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and i don't mean to sound that way but it's true it's just um you have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you um to not compare yourself to other people because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their  their time and their progression to how they get to things so i would tell me ten years ago to just believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that i want for my life and don't be  yeah  um really enjoyed working with um well  okay a science project <laughter> with um my younger uh relatives my cousins we did a science project together and it was fun despite the mess we made it was a ball um being the first to attend college in my family and then um going to college and coming back to the community where i uh went to school and then teaching in that community and volunteering in that community and helping um youth or children that come from the same background that i came from so  uh i'm most proud of being able to  have the opportunity to improve and better myself and then to come back and help someone else improve and better themself as well   goodbye

with my mom and sister yesterday it was just something stupid over like my sister is sitting was sitting in the front seat and she's a kid and it's like i'm i should be in the front seat so i just asked her to sit in the back and of course they start like yelling and arguing and it's like really annoying <laughter>  yeah it does thanks  my grandma she's always giving me encouragement and um she's a therapist a licensed therapist so she's always you know made it really really um  easy for me to have someone to talk to and i could always go to her so that helps yeah  yeah  my most

really hard um   i don't usually sleep well so um yeah i have trouble falling asleep mostly  um i guess it's just like my mind will be racing a lot of you know sometimes it'll be flashbacks of bad memories um just you know thinking too much <laughter> um i don't know um i think just uh  stress you know a lot of stress every day just everyday stress uh yeah pretty much that's what triggers it <laughter>  um i just try to stay positive i try to think like okay well you know one day things will get better um   i just i try to call somebody and talk to them if i have trouble like my grandma

was like okay well this is the problem and it i just wanted help because it just when your mind is after you like that's like it's just awful to have your mind taking control of you like that  yeah  yeah it's hard  um yeah yeah i definitely always thought i had a problem i always thought something was like really wrong um i just always like kinda nervous around people like i never can really like look anybody in the eye 'cause i'm just so nervous my eyes are always kind of like racing and i um would have sweats if i was in the situation um that reminded me of the situation like i just try to avoid what reminds me and brings those flashbacks yeah  oh um i i've been feeling good i've been getting out more every day i'm trying to um i guess walking keeps my mind off my p_t_s_d symptoms so

keep more occupied yeah it helps  um the last time i felt really happy um i guess um i don't know um today 'cause i mean i'm glad to be part of this <laughter>  um most proud of uh well <sigh> um i'm trying to think of what i'm most proud of um  i  think i'm most proud of like the fact that i am able to you know not be like well i mean most people i know they like deny that they have a problem and i'm proud that i can actually like you know be a person who can realize okay i have a problem and i need help but a lot of the people i know they don't take medication they're untreated and um they just don't wanna get any help and i'm glad to get help because i don't wanna feel that way and i wanna get help for the problem instead of doing that  oh gosh there's a lot i regret yeah there's a lot um i regret you know uh drug abuse you know but that's part of you know the p_t_s_d i regret um a lot uh mistakes you know relationships stuff like that  wow um i would've told myself to um i guess the advice i would've given myself was to  try to keep my mind more relaxed i guess yeah um well i'm a very nice person and i always like to smile people are always saying how i smile a lot but um the

like to play video games those are fun stuff like that okay thanks goodbye
325,female,0,10,yes um i'm fine this is a little bit strange you know talking to a virtual human um i was born i was born in l_a i was raised out in the suburbs um i've lived all over los angeles i've lived in the valley long beach and now i'm in culver city um there's great food here the weather is great most of the time there's a lot of sunshine it doesn't get cold i don't have to shovel snow there are lots of opportunities a lot of diversity all different sorts of people uh i think that's really great  that is a much longer list i would like to get out of here um the the traffic i think that's number one i think everybody hates the traffic and everybody's so busy all the time it's really hard to to get together with anybody everybody's so devoted to their jobs and uh then we're sitting in traffic a lot too  i just graduated actually um i studied marine biology i was i went to school and i orginally studied um graphic design and i found that kind of unfulfilling so i took a trip for a while traveled around the world and started scuba diving and i realized that i really loved marine biology so that's how i got into it  everybody's been asking me that a lot lately since i just graduated i think i would like to <exhaling>  um i think maybe managing a um managing a research you know i'm not i'm not really sure i think i would like to something in tropical marine ecology maybe like managing a preserve um something like that it's a hard question to answer <laughter> i do um i like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world well i traveled for eight months in central america um and i visited a lot of different countries i um i went scuba diving i think um i think intolerance injustice in the world those are probably the things that get me the most fired up vent to my boyfriend does that count <laughter> i'm pretty good it takes it takes a lot to really get me um fired up to the point where i i kinda blow my top the very few people that have seen me angry um to the point where i'm kind of yelling and screaming angry um i don't know i just don't get there i think that i'm a little bit afraid of losing my temper so i keep it under control  <laughter> it was yesterday actually i argued with my boyfriend um about uh getting getting a job i was talking about taking a job somewhere and he was being very supportive and i really wanted him to to say no don't go take that job for six months 'cause i would miss you and he was just being supportive so um we kind of argued about that <laughter> and it was ridiculous so we i ended up laughing and that was the end of the fight um meditate excercise go out in nature just um unplug get myself away from the computer away from technology away from people  i would say not really um i'm an only child and it's just me and my parents and we're very very dissimilar for example um i'm a pretty adventurous person and i like learning and my parents are uh couch potatoes they like to watch reality television so we don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do um as far as shared activites so you know i love them and everything but there's not too much common ground yes i think i'm a very social introvert but i seem to find most social encounters to be draining where as my my boyfriend for example he um derives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people for me it's always a little bit the opposite i have to recharge  i not sure i have a best friend but um i guess i'll say my boyfriend he's he's kinda my default best friend um he would probably say passionate intelligent um he always tells me that i'm really hard on myself which is true um dedicated loyal   i think i'm just proud of who i am xxx i don't know if that's the answer that most people give but i think that i'm i'm really proud of who i am i try really hard um i've done a lot of things in my life i'm a really good person i think it's it's kind of rare to find people that are kind and i consider myself  a kind person that that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place so i'm i'm proud of that <laughter> no i have not no yes i was probably about fifteen at the time so i think eight was is that seventeen years ago  yes um i was cutting and my one of my best friends called um called my parents and let them know and at that point they took me in for treatment i that wasn't the first time i had ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist but um before it was more they thought i had a_d_h_d so um it was more <m> i think my parents really took me in rather than me seeking help i haven't for about three years uh i stopped because it felt like uh i was checking in with a parole officer i just wasn't enjoying the relationship i had but i still have the psychiatrist that i go to for med checks  <laughter> uh i do think it's useful if you have the right therapist i think if you don't have a good relationship with your therapist it can be incredibly harmful i have talked to people that have had bad experiences and and won't ever go back lately i've been a little bit down um i should say a little bit more down than usual because i graduated and my routine of go to school and do school things twenty four seven has come to an end and without the routine it's been a little bit  weird finding out what to do with my finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time it's also been a little bit um depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesn't translate to real world skills and there aren't that many jobs for marine biologists in california  almost impossible ever since i was a little kid i had a i had trouble falling asleep and um about four years ago it it became really really bad where i just couldn't sleep through the night i was getting about four hours of sleep  sometimes i would wake up every hour and i'd wake up in the morning just a complete wreck so for about four years i've been taking trazadone so i can sleep um have you ever seen fight club um you're a virtual human so you probably haven't seen that but it's it's pretty much like that i i'm just um a complete panicked anxious wreck i i lose my ability to deal with um i lose my ability to deal with things i'm much more likely to lose my temper um i can't regulate my moods i'm just really volatile probably a few months ago i think that i may have been on a trip gone away for a weekend and forgotten to take my medicine with me um or something like that and then i can't sleep and so that's what happens   uh <makes sound with mouth> really happy i mean um i don't know it's easy for me easier for me to keep track of when i feel really really bad really happy i guess i felt happy on new year's really happy on new year's eve which was um uh ten days ago um i was with my boyfriend and some friends and we took a trip out to palm spring and joshua tree and it was really nice to see them i don't get to see them very often um because i've been in school and i've been so busy so it was really nice reintroduction to uh real life i think that i'm i'm kind i'm considerate i'm tolerant i'm pretty open minded i'm aware of my faults um i just i just try to be nice to everybody and i'm very curious about um about the world and things that i don't know about i really like to learn  uh off the top of my head first thing that came comes to mind is diving the blue whole in belize it was really amazing um it was me and my friends we just you know jumped off the boat and you come up over the edge of this uh limestone sink hole and it's really really really blue and you just drop down to about a hundred and forty feet in something like two minutes we did it pretty quick not everybody could do it that quick and um as you go down you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they're huge they're larger than human and 'cause it's this  cave system um and it's really murky and there's sharks swimming all around you so  that was that was pretty good <laughter>  i'm trying to remember that at the moment i haven't had much free time the last three and a half years being in school um <laughter> so uh i guess reading hiking um just being together with my friends doing um relatively low key things going to movies having dinner parties cooking playing with my cat not that i can really think of i'm sure i've made mistakes in my life but um you know i'm still here so can't be that bad hmm um i don't know hang in there um hold on to your clothes 'cause the nineties are coming back in fashion hmm um cloudy weather uh beautiful sunsets being in um being out in nature kind of being away from the hubub of the city getting a good grade <laughter> i think my boyfriend has he's just um especially the last year he's really inspired me he quit drinking he quit smoking he's  really inspired me he quit drinking he quit smoking he's made a lot of positive changes in his life and i know that those things aren't aren't hard or aren't easy i should say um to <t> so to see someone overcome that  uh really inspired me  okay
428,male,0,0,<synch> <laughter> yeah i'm good how are you i'm from here <he> um from los angeles <clears throat> probably the downtown the view and it's not that i like it but that's just where i for my parents were so that's where i grew up nothing that's where i live i i love l_a <laughter> maybe that it's ghetto but that's about it <laughter> <clears throat> i was thinking of going for sound engineer or mechanic hmm but i'm not sure <clears throat> 'cause <cau> 'cause my dad um he used to do that mm i'm not even sure to be honest haven't really thought about it i can't look at your shoes uh no i don't travel like that i don't know maybe money <m> money issue or something if i had money yeah i'll go all all over the world just <laughter> probably um outgoing depends i guess i don't know <laughter> about what shy or outgoing <clears throat> well outgoing you could be outgoing at a party you know like you're already out there so you can't be shy i guess if you're going to a party good probably um my girlfriend and 'cause i missed work 'cause i just felt lazy i was like whatever you know i just didn't wanna go and i i do what i want <laughter> i just didn't go nah not really she's over it already as long as we have the bills and rent paid <laughter> don't worry guilty probably nothing i guess i should've gone to work <laughter> mm <clears throat> damn that i could erase from that probably bad friends that i've met you know like friends that trick you you know that said that that they just trick you friends that deceive you i guess okay like um my friend told me that he had a good job at some car wash place so he told me to to he's gonna get me hired there and give me direct deposit but then he ended up actually going into my account and taking money from my account so <laughter> <clears throat> probably moving out and into my mom's house yeah i haven't really been around eh like a big decision like that i wanted my own space you know my own life i wanna do what i want and come home when i want leave when i want yeah <laughter> yeah <laughter> uh we're all close we're all you know we hardly argue we're all always around we always see each other my mom my dad my brother <laughter> how they were a positive in my life well they're always there for you you know whether you have financial problems they're there they help you out whether you're sad they know you know and they'd be like hey what's wrong you know let's go out and eat somewhere just to cheer you up they're xxx they're your family and they're always there to motivate you and keep you going <sigh> uh easy actually yeah pretty easy i'm sorry um i haven't noticed but maybe probably the same you know i don't think sleep does affect you but i don't know maybe more tired but i don't think annoyed or mad or anything like that good everything's great um maybe that i wanna start <s> know like start a new business or something <clears throat> well like my dad um he wasn't around for a while but he just got back and um he actually opened up a shop and he's getting a a a lot of customers so i see that his business is growing so i'm probably gonna learn learn <lear> um learn mechanic like like i was saying earlier at school <clears throat> i don't even know what it what is that no nope <coughs> <coughs> i'm sorry um yesterday <laughter> last night 'cause i got a new game <laughter> <coughs> that i'm funny <laughter> i uh uh no <coughs> um i don't think nothing everything's fine you know thank god everything's good right now i don't think there's nothing to change like that maybe a better job well first of all i don't even have a job so i guess to change i get a job nah it's hard for someone to put me down like that <clears throat> xxx could say probably that i'm responsible as well at home resting and then i call some friends over they usually do come over barbecue whatever comes to mind you know just there in my house 'cause i have a nice backyard 'cause i just moved to this new house so so far each xxx yeah so each weekend right now we just people come over family come over and we pretty pretty much just barbecue there just hang out <clears throat> my sister's birthday party it was on saturday and it was fun there was a lot of dancing you know people uh i saw family that i haven't seen for a while so i enjoyed doing that so <clears throat> probably that i was like i was able to help my mom throughout because she was going through a really hard time my mom and um for almost nine years 'cause she was having hard trouble paying bills and rent so i i'm proud that i was able to help her even though i could only give so little but she at least we're all still good you know and we're still alive and everyone's still blessed and um being around my family music music always puts me in a good mood any kinda music even if it's even if it's depressing music it's still gonna <go> it it's still gonna get me happy yeah <laughter> mhm no problem anytime bye mm am i supposed to press the button <laughter> you say yeah <laughter>
469,female,0,3,I'm just supposed to watch her I'm supposed to do something  oh okay okay  and again when she says goodbye just press this button and I'll come back and go you're welcome  yes  I'm okay  hello  oh there's a lot of variety there's a lot of Health oriented stuff  there's all kinds of food to eat you can go to the desert and go to the you can go anywhere I mean there's a lot  and the weather is great  the traffic  lately the change in weather it's kind of a little too unpredictable but it mainly the traffic and sometimes some rudeness of people  I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world  I want say a lot just occasionally  it's nice to get a change of scenery and different things to do that maybe I wouldn't normally do different people learning about different people different customs  depends I mean if it's the water real pretty water and you know being in beautiful water relaxing Adventure I love Adventure  some time ago I went to Cayman Islands and  went on I get seasick but my sister gave me some medication I went on a boat and we snorkeled and there were two boats and I accidentally got back on the wrong boat yeah and they're really crazy they made me jump back into the water and swim to the right boat and I thought I was going to drown because the water was kind of rough I was really shocked that they wanted me to do that  yeah but I survived  you're pretty good  business management  but also also hypnotherapy  I didn't hear that other question  well I came from a serious kind of families so that just seemed something that would be a universal that will cover a lot of different subjects  yes yeah but yes or no I mean now I kind of wish it was something different  I like communication I love speaking and interviewing strangers I'm very outgoing and funny so probably would have been something more like either liberal arts communication that type of thing  dream job which is be out there you know like some of these people may be on TV exploring different places and getting paid for it and always like a fun adventure interacting with people doing things I haven't done before and helping people you know on some way with what I do you could that they can see you know  but I'm uncoordinated and in some ways and you know they could be uncoordinated and have some fun too  I watch TV I go workout go walking I recently like a bike that I kind of sort of fixed up go do something new go to a festival go grocery shopping in Iraq with friends call them see them  that type of thing  talk to strangers  depends on the situation there's a bunch of time so I'm good at it if it has to do with like traffic and cars it's a little more intense for me. Or people were like really rude you know with the way they cut you off  almost  luckily not you know I'm very assertive and maybe too much sometimes we're if somebody does something really rude to me in a parking lot I'll I'll confront them on that sometimes  might have been with my sister  I had to do with I'm not sure of the topic but whatever she was saying wasn't right and we got in an argument it sounds childish about who was right you know cuz she thinks she's always the smarter one cuz she's older  sometimes it's frustrating cuz it's like it's a no-win situation she just wants to hammer on somebody till you know they acknowledged that she's right other times I just let it go and let her ride along cuz it's  those kind of non productive  I'm real close to I see my parents almost every weekend more close to my mother  I have a twin sister I stay in touch with her even though she's out of town she lives out of town and I've got two other sister so I stay in touch with all of them you know it's a mixed bag you know  be kind of assertive aggressiveness in us in a little bit  but also  well me and ever I mean stranger sometimes my family you know they've done nice things for me to strangers have been very sometimes unexpectedly very nice  I could be shopping and you know maybe I can't reach something and some guy I'll pop up behind me and you know without me saying anything just help me out  that type of thing or  if somebody's like kind of mean to me somebody all like commiserate you know  anti  I had a situation years ago with a neighbor where he was really nasty to me cuz he thought I didn't like his dog was you know I'm not crazy about dogs but he kind of flipped out for a year-and-a-half and just said very nasty things to me when other people weren't around I wish I had confronted that back then because I yeah but it create a lot of anxiety for me cuz I feel like I could have nipped it in the bud and instead of having to deal with the  major stress from it now he and I don't talk at all I just feel it's best it's kind of odd  God there's been a lot  sometimes breaking up with somebody or  yeah Sushi or getting rid of a friend  that type of thing  sometimes I feel guilty about some of my past Behavior with people  or maybe I wasn't his understanding  when I was younger I stole things you know that's not the best behavior and  kind of stuff like that  oh God there's a lot of them  I wish I could have raised you know how tough my dad was on us as children  and erase a lot of memories of men I dated that just didn't work out well at all  now  I can drop off like right away  cranky irritated  snarky  I've been out of sorts some I've had some anxiety with money and relationships cuz I haven't been in one for so long male  just a lot of anxiety  take a deep breath trying to do positive things so you know sometimes eat healthy or work out more talk to my friend about it  that type of thing try and look for interesting activities to do to distract me  will not officially but I know you know from things have experience that I've had you not get very anxious and certain situations  yeah it's usually triggered by  sometimes if somebody gets really angry and crazy it triggers a lot of anxiety in me if they're aggressive whether it be physically or verbally or sometimes if they're too much in my my space you know where I am if it bothers me  yeah a long time ago  ages ago  maybe over 10 years ago 15 years ago  I was depressed I mean it's nothing to laugh about but I mean it's kind of  a circle just to want to be more positive and enjoy life more  feeling stuck in certain thoughts I'm having a lot of negative thoughts feeling of hopelessness helplessness  that type of thing  I go occasionally it's a different type I'll go see a hypnotherapist sometimes to release anxiety that's in me  yes I do very useful  I want more awareness of myself and other people  learning more control more confidence better self-esteem willing to try even more things you know whether I know the outcome or not you know of the unknown I'll experiment a lot more  helping like at the 25th mile heading out water and there are some people there who are doing that for the first time also  some event at my sister's where they were just a couple of us and I was cracking a lot of jokes sometimes I'm like really funny you know and I can't even believe myself and I just go on and you know that one starts laughing I'm not even trying to and I'm just saying like regular stories and people look at me funny laugh yeah  as a really decent loyal empathetic deserving  supportive I'm hoping  outgoing quirky type of person  look be great to look even younger or be younger  if that was humanly possible  be even more patient with people I think you know not get frustrated like if I think somebody is not very smart sometimes it's real frustrating for me to be around some types of people  well  wow  make a lot of money and plan for your future  and  try and be as kind of impatient with people as possible and have a lot of fun trying new things  I think of my mind and my perseverance that I've changed a lot of things within my personality  I feel proud of volunteer work I feel proud I felt a bunch of people lose weight declutter their homes and helped create a lot of positive change in people  okay  it was nice talking to you  when she nods her head a lot
