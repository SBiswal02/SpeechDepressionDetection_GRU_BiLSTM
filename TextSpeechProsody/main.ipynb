         "yeah there's also on Craigslist so that's why okay  how are you doing today I'm doing good thank you  I'm from Los Angeles  I'm great  I live in West Los Angeles the west side  it's all right  I live alone so  I love it I'm from here so I grew up here it's natural  the weather on the weather  it's always good you never never bad there's always something to do really dull moment  traffic  the traffic is horrible I'll probably traffic is horrible in almost any major city but I hate the traffic  not really I mean I have enough things going on here so if I travel it's usually somewhere this within driving distance  I study business I didn't  no I've been done for a few years so I haven't gone to school for a while one of these days I'll go back to graduate school but  my dream job would be to just work for myself and make some money  I don't know I don't really have a dream job just something that I can I can work under my own terms and get paid decently and being a creative creative environment  I don't know I think it's just a matter of finding the right situation so right now at its people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they wanted it so it's a little tougher than it should be but I don't know I think when the situation is right I don't think it's too difficult  yep  I work as an administrative assistant through a temp agency so  I just basically has to get sent out to do to do desk jobs  yes or no I mean I feel like I feel like I could do more but now it works so  I'm pretty close there around so  I really mad  stupid people just basically doing doing anything to annoy me  that's because that's the big thing just irritating stupid people just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all  what's a good example  this random people who think it's funny that just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn't have to be one any specific situation it's just people who just think it's funny that I think they're just generally sadistic and they just think it's funny to it just probably like it's like poking a stick and an angry dog knowing that they know how they just want to push your buttons for no reason so  I don't remember what those situations I usually try not to remember when it happens I just I just let it go and just like the past of the past I tend not to look back  what do you mean  okay  at what I do to relax I like to run I like to go to the gym  listen to music a lot of Musician's Friend so I just I'm usually around musicians so anything of that sort I like I like everything from Lockhart to tattoos to just anything that's that's generally art and creative  who's been deposit  they just friends and general who received the we seem to do well and I think they are very inspiring and  which is sometimes a little bit tough and in a town like Los Angeles where I think everybody is on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't it's sometimes hard to find someone who is going to be uplifting or try to be inspiring so  I don't really have anybody in particular but people kind of brought up things here and there  yeah it's like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or egg you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just now I'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe I might I can do differently instead of just being negative thing hey don't do that that's no that's why you doing that it's a waste of time  I guess it depends on who you talk to  I'm okay at it I can probably work at that I don't know I mean I can I think I can do better  go back to the point about people provoking me so I mean I try not to blow Steam and let them get under my skin so I just usually try not to let it get to me but I don't know I guess what temper is it depends on how I handle my stress lately I've been better at it just because I think my situation has been a little bit better  now  now  no  nothing major and maybe when I was younger I could have traveled more I could have worked towards something that paid better job-wise but I mean those are all things that I think at any point in life you always think like why could have should have would have done but you know  but then again I think that's natural for anybody I mean I could I could have become a banker or I could have become a lawyer or doctor made. 10 times the money that I make now but but then again I don't like law and I don't like Madison so so it wasn't meant to be so  yeah  I think  I think my in my life I knew that there's a lot of things I have there's more things in life so I kind of narrowed it down to what am I good at and what am I not good at and what am I going to work well or who am I going to work well with and I not work well with so I kind of I kind of sort it out and then the list kind of  I'm kind of answered itself so  no it's I don't think it was hard but it was just but I think it was a real reality check and I think it's it's kind of a good thing cuz sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense it's like trying to shovel around peg into a square square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not going to go and so sometimes it just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you  memorable experiences  I think it's just I don't really have like anyone in particular I think I think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative I think it's just everything from getting it just the fact that  I got a job and I can I can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person as it sounds stupid but you know I think just the fact that I'm able I'm able to get this far in life without completely self-destructing is already in accomplishments so I feel like  I gotten somewhere  maybe not tonight maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire  yeah  I want the last time I really felt happy  I don't know I'm not really someone who is like  I don't have any real high highs or low lows I mean I haven't hit any Lowe's so I mean  I don't know I'm usually pretty I feel like I'm a level person and I'm pretty everyday I feel like if I accomplish one thing that I'm pretty happy so I guess the answer the question probably  probably yesterday I just feel like if I if I'm able to accomplish something then then hey I'm happy  no I don't really have a best friend but I mean well dance a question generally friends  I think they would say that I'm very outgoing I'm pretty determined  I'm trying now I tried I try to interact as much as possible I'm always out networking as much as possible so  I don't know I guess that's basically what I think they would describe me is  okay  no problem  all right  I was weird  play unplugged toaster"

I think you're pressure and can totally LOL dolls ready thing a parent is trying to put into a child.  Yeah  can you give me an example that you have a daughter for being a now at The Graduate law school when she even said we'd kept her in Beverly Hills schools and Asthma of those very wealthy kids with hearing name celebrity families whose white chocolate Jesse got in trouble for that one sitting and not because she wasn't influenced so that was a really bad time for us  what do you think I think it depends on which neighborhood or state you're in or are they the think there are little misguided as a little tired right now I can throw them away down by the concerns of the wars and and things like that and I think they could probably use that as a common goal a common in our now is he as a separate group that had once they were I think  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep I worry sometimes about work issues than pretty pretty easy do you feel that way often I don't feel like I'm not sleeping I just know Caitlin will worry about nothing work when was the last time that happened a couple weeks ago  how did you feel in that moment I just died you know unfortunately have to worry you don't unfortunate this is it easier to operate between people it's almost everything you know so you always want to have that around you  what are you like when you don't sleep well just stressed out stressed or unstressed  that sounds really hard  do you feel down and fatigue has a lot of your applications for just not feeling like yourself or Miss judging same as he might judge differently if you were arrested  have you been diagnosed with depression and not depression  have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD probably I was that was to consider the possibility of had an employment lawsuit several years ago and and actually litigated it and want to settle city of whistleblower thing and locations of that and contrast about it and so I found when I got out of it I couldn't find work right away in my feels I had to go into the field go back to you till I get a new and a professional Direction and I found myself fearful sometimes it's going to happen again and I need to make them  I'm sorry to hear that  what got you to seek help just that I was noticing that I was noticing that I was feeling very in my paralegal class I had a section about employment law and there was a very complicated filing I done with grape adult work and study for my case that once its face with it again in that class setting I just I just couldn't get it done I was late is a late paper for me and I realized it was traumatized by having to go through that again we have post-traumatic stress and I couldn't later after the adrenaline dies down the one I understand and so I think it was just stuff it was just kidding me later and I was having a face that paper again  just just extreme you know avoidance of getting something done it shouldn't easy for me and and thinking about it as thoroughly as I should ever studying at are putting it off and putting the feeling of going threw that paper that type of paper you have just a class assignment again  have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughtful  well I'm not lately you know back then for sure when that happened which is about ten years ago now with someone quarterback 7 years ago now and yeah it was it was effective I was affected the way you do most everything and your confidence in that kind of thing  I'm sorry repeat the question  a peaceful do I feel peaceful well yeah I was peaceful that it was settled that bit angry that it ever happened so it's hard to all probably not ever feel peaceful about that issue ever and always dimension of always makes me angry that I had to go through that  yeah he's done anything to avoid it I don't think so I tried everything to avoid it and so I think that's that was aggravating for me to get my patient person realistic and I'm and I tried everything to avoid a confrontation the matter but which is required to try to help me cover with the damage to our lives My Daughter's Eyes  do you consider yourself an introvert I am not now maybe one time in my life.

         "yeah there's also on Craigslist so that's why okay  how are you doing today I'm doing good thank you  I'm from Los Angeles  I'm great  I live in West Los Angeles the west side  it's all right  I live alone so  I love it I'm from here so I grew up here it's natural  the weather on the weather  it's always good you never never bad there's always something to do really dull moment  traffic  the traffic is horrible I'll probably traffic is horrible in almost any major city but I hate the traffic  not really I mean I have enough things going on here so if I travel it's usually somewhere this within driving distance  I study business I didn't  no I've been done for a few years so I haven't gone to school for a while one of these days I'll go back to graduate school but  my dream job would be to just work for myself and make some money  I don't know I don't really have a dream job just something that I can I can work under my own terms and get paid decently and being a creative creative environment  I don't know I think it's just a matter of finding the right situation so right now at its people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they wanted it so it's a little tougher than it should be but I don't know I think when the situation is right I don't think it's too difficult  yep  I work as an administrative assistant through a temp agency so  I just basically has to get sent out to do to do desk jobs  yes or no I mean I feel like I feel like I could do more but now it works so  I'm pretty close there around so  I really mad  stupid people just basically doing doing anything to annoy me  that's because that's the big thing just irritating stupid people just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all  what's a good example  this random people who think it's funny that just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn't have to be one any specific situation it's just people who just think it's funny that I think they're just generally sadistic and they just think it's funny to it just probably like it's like poking a stick and an angry dog knowing that they know how they just want to push your buttons for no reason so  I don't remember what those situations I usually try not to remember when it happens I just I just let it go and just like the past of the past I tend not to look back  what do you mean  okay  at what I do to relax I like to run I like to go to the gym  listen to music a lot of Musician's Friend so I just I'm usually around musicians so anything of that sort I like I like everything from Lockhart to tattoos to just anything that's that's generally art and creative  who's been deposit  they just friends and general who received the we seem to do well and I think they are very inspiring and  which is sometimes a little bit tough and in a town like Los Angeles where I think everybody is on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't it's sometimes hard to find someone who is going to be uplifting or try to be inspiring so  I don't really have anybody in particular but people kind of brought up things here and there  yeah it's like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or egg you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just now I'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe I might I can do differently instead of just being negative thing hey don't do that that's no that's why you doing that it's a waste of time  I guess it depends on who you talk to  I'm okay at it I can probably work at that I don't know I mean I can I think I can do better  go back to the point about people provoking me so I mean I try not to blow Steam and let them get under my skin so I just usually try not to let it get to me but I don't know I guess what temper is it depends on how I handle my stress lately I've been better at it just because I think my situation has been a little bit better  now  now  no  nothing major and maybe when I was younger I could have traveled more I could have worked towards something that paid better job-wise but I mean those are all things that I think at any point in life you always think like why could have should have would have done but you know  but then again I think that's natural for anybody I mean I could I could have become a banker or I could have become a lawyer or doctor made. 10 times the money that I make now but but then again I don't like law and I don't like Madison so so it wasn't meant to be so  yeah  I think  I think my in my life I knew that there's a lot of things I have there's more things in life so I kind of narrowed it down to what am I good at and what am I not good at and what am I going to work well or who am I going to work well with and I not work well with so I kind of I kind of sort it out and then the list kind of  I'm kind of answered itself so  no it's I don't think it was hard but it was just but I think it was a real reality check and I think it's it's kind of a good thing cuz sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense it's like trying to shovel around peg into a square square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not going to go and so sometimes it just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you  memorable experiences  I think it's just I don't really have like anyone in particular I think I think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative I think it's just everything from getting it just the fact that  I got a job and I can I can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person as it sounds stupid but you know I think just the fact that I'm able I'm able to get this far in life without completely self-destructing is already in accomplishments so I feel like  I gotten somewhere  maybe not tonight maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire  yeah  I want the last time I really felt happy  I don't know I'm not really someone who is like  I don't have any real high highs or low lows I mean I haven't hit any Lowe's so I mean  I don't know I'm usually pretty I feel like I'm a level person and I'm pretty everyday I feel like if I accomplish one thing that I'm pretty happy so I guess the answer the question probably  probably yesterday I just feel like if I if I'm able to accomplish something then then hey I'm happy  no I don't really have a best friend but I mean well dance a question generally friends  I think they would say that I'm very outgoing I'm pretty determined  I'm trying now I tried I try to interact as much as possible I'm always out networking as much as possible so  I don't know I guess that's basically what I think they would describe me is  okay  no problem  all right  I was weird  play unplugged toaster"

job opportunities than other states pretty much that is big and it's a lot you can do here  traffic Maybe  the violence right the bad news even though you don't even want to know what's going on in your environment but you still have to watch it so you can you know look out to see what's going on on a daily basis  sociology I have a  2 year degree in Liberal Arts but my major was sociology  no I'm actually MTA bus operator  what's your  well since Metro is study growing my dream job is to move up in the company and I'm about to actually start some classes for supervisor free next week so cuz they look to promote within the company so that's a good thing is a lot of opportunities at Metro where you can take classes in their pay for your tuition and things of that nature  thanks  well it's not actually hard as right now is easy if you take advantage of it right now cuz they look to promote within so you know since I'm already working there that's a good thing so is good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible  what do you mean I'm sorry  okay  free take a long walk hot bath  meditate just close my eyes sometimes  okay  I'm pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you got to remain calm and still remain professional at the same time  well I look at it like it it goes with a Ami comes with experience you know you do something on a continuous basis usually you somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so I I look at it like that so I've been driving for years and dealing with the public so it's just how you handle circumstances how you treat people like you want to be treated  I'm pretty good at it now maybe when I were younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and I'm still learning today  I will say my family you know my kids so you know even though you don't have been having a lot of deaths around me but that's just that's part of the  life experience you know you born here but you got to leave here one day but  my kids will keep me you don't saying and you know I love them in my family  thank you  no  set good examples you know because you're the first teacher you know and you want to set a positive good example for your kids and I think that's a good thing and it starts at home  well  by you being the first teacher your kids you're that you're you're the one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they looking and learn everyday you know brother is that homeschool you know kids have a tendency to do things with a c you know what I mean so you try to keep it positive teaching good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature  I have a 4 1/2 year old son I have a seven-year-old daughter and I also have a 23 year old  yeah I'm about to be well my daughter's pregnant with the boy she has three little girls go have three grand kids and one on the way which is the boy this time  yeah thank you  the hardest thing is we're right now I'm a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and  they can be expensive at times you know and depends on the person's situation you know whether they have helped or job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you are trying to keep a job you know keep food in the house you know just maintaining support my kids the best way I can  with my kids or Just.  what's memorable for me is that I'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kind of like yeah it's kind of even though I'm the baby of 10 kids you know and I always kept in the back of my mind even though everybody will pretty much my whole family have decent job but I'm the one with the degree so I kind of like gave myself a pat on the back like you know you know I just that's the only thing I remember and graduating you know and my family is there to support me  thank you  happy that I accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just having a high school diploma and I had I was working on my bachelors degree but I ended up in a bad car accident I never went back I got distracted and you know I was working at the same time but I was just like more so I needed income then then I'm schooling at that time because I was a young parent you know cuz I have my daughter at 17 so I was like I made it the money to support her but I never went back but I feel like it's never too late so I feel like I take some classes now that I'm with Metro to help me move up the ladder so that's why I'm starting my class next week  thank you  well device I would have gave myself  then I probably would have been a young mother at a young age and that  I probably wouldn't  stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not I would have remained in school I probably would have had kids early you know  whether I probably would have stayed in school and probably have a part-time job or something just I just feel like education is an excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learn different things keep your mind open to learning new ideas every day so I think that's a plus you know and anybody shoes that's the better they sells you know through education maybe two maybe promote within your company or whatever the case maybe they help better your career  I'm quite sure you learn from your mistakes you know you but the same time you don't continue to make the same ones I feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know like myself even though I'm going to school late but still I'm going you know I want to better myself career-wise so  yes  my oldest daughter  we had an argument because  the life she's living right now in the things that she's going through and I had told her that she just need to make some changes to better her situation and I'll we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't want to hear it you know here's the stuff that you're saying even though  is true or  or they just you know quote they just don't want to hear it you know they may be going through something they don't want to hear but we got into argument about it but  lettuce happened you know  I just told her my I'm sorry  very close very close is that the situation my daughter's name right now she just needs to make some changes to better her her life  and I've been  she kind of like stubborn in their own way you know I was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom is not going to tell you nothing wrong and I've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's kind of like I was talking to a wall because she did the opposite and now she's she regretting it you know cuz she's like my mom told me that I'm doing the opposite so I guess you got a bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kind of like I didn't told you I left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change  how hot is it  it's very frustrating because it's like I'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me and I'm like it seems like it's taking forever for the change but it's left up to the individual when they're ready you know what I mean one supposed to get tired of something they make a change it may not be when you wanted to have him but  the ball is in her Court you know  only can do so much  oh wow  Oh my days  since I have two little ones my kind of like trying to go to bed at 8 because you know they got to go to school and I think it's important have a good night's rest because it kind of like  it it kind of like I guess you're ready for the next day or you know how you going to feel if you rested what type of person going to be that day you know cuz everybody have their days you know rather than good or bad but that's just part of life and I feel like if you had a good night good good night rest hopefully you have a good day you know  pretty much you know I need my rest because I'm out there driving a bus and dealing with all these people and you know the job is stuff is very stressful so I feel like if I'm rested and it helped me  what am I like irritated tired lazy  you know  feel like I want to lay down probably go to sleep  never thought about that you know  cuz like I said you know everybody had a moment to do  I thought about that  no  no  okay  how your best friend describe you I don't really have a best friend but person that I deal with it I used to work with she'll probably tell you that I'm very outgoing a go-getter Dependable responsible  I'm a people person  I get along with others you know I'm kind of like  I live in a good Mark  whether I know you are not if you was to you know like like you and I now you know I I I  you probably sell she seems like a nice young lady or whatever you know something like that  thank you  well  I try to stay happy I rather be happy than sad my kids keep me going you know what I mean  especially when I go to pick him up from school or just up to me  thank you  you're more than welcome you have a good day  goodbye  you're welcome  okay  that is so interesting"

I really don't like that  yeah so but I mean we're fine now  so that's good  tonight  believe people so easily  so gullible is not be so gullible  I guess I've been hearing that lately how I believe anybody anything that somebody says about really thinking about it or without having them prove it so I guess you can say I made a lot of mistakes I don't regret it because I'm glad I went through while younger than me even older and going to the same situation so  yeah I believe people too easily and I get people to his chances  so yeah  when I went on a cruise would you have experience when I went on a cruise to Mexico with my family when I was 16 by 6 years ago  yeah I mean yeah I guess  no I really want you though  trying new things singing new views of the world I'm trying a different type of foods seeing how the government is and how they run the things out there I guess  yeah I plan to go to the Bahamas next year I find a lot of traveling last year actually  just pretty good  omelette  I'm tired and I kind of fall asleep during class and what not  do you feel that way often yeah is my fault though  probably today  or I fell asleep late so it's my fault  I'm not so pretty happy right now  no no  no  how do your best friend  very friendly and funny  talkative through High School  I'm pretty close we'll try to talk as often as possible maybe once a week I'll try to see them at least every few months  they're everywhere no comment off of that earn back in a day they are learning their very progressing but when it comes to technology or not outside our nature or about the little things in life ages yeah but when it comes to the mentality they are getting smarter cuz the schools are getting better I ain't going to lie so  when what happened  last weekend I guess  I'd love to hear all about it  right now  I'm being on my boyfriend makes me really happy so I was just hanging out with him last weekend and I never really get to see him that much so yeah cuz he works fast School different schedules  not that bad  how do you know that  he's my boyfriend I've been knowing him for about 6 months now  we met through a mutual friend in La I guess  awesome  okay  thanks for sharing your thoughts with me you're welcome  but I'll be right there so I wasn't sure if that was part of it or not"

         "yeah there's also on Craigslist so that's why okay  how are you doing today I'm doing good thank you  I'm from Los Angeles  I'm great  I live in West Los Angeles the west side  it's all right  I live alone so  I love it I'm from here so I grew up here it's natural  the weather on the weather  it's always good you never never bad there's always something to do really dull moment  traffic  the traffic is horrible I'll probably traffic is horrible in almost any major city but I hate the traffic  not really I mean I have enough things going on here so if I travel it's usually somewhere this within driving distance  I study business I didn't  no I've been done for a few years so I haven't gone to school for a while one of these days I'll go back to graduate school but  my dream job would be to just work for myself and make some money  I don't know I don't really have a dream job just something that I can I can work under my own terms and get paid decently and being a creative creative environment  I don't know I think it's just a matter of finding the right situation so right now at its people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they wanted it so it's a little tougher than it should be but I don't know I think when the situation is right I don't think it's too difficult  yep  I work as an administrative assistant through a temp agency so  I just basically has to get sent out to do to do desk jobs  yes or no I mean I feel like I feel like I could do more but now it works so  I'm pretty close there around so  I really mad  stupid people just basically doing doing anything to annoy me  that's because that's the big thing just irritating stupid people just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all  what's a good example  this random people who think it's funny that just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn't have to be one any specific situation it's just people who just think it's funny that I think they're just generally sadistic and they just think it's funny to it just probably like it's like poking a stick and an angry dog knowing that they know how they just want to push your buttons for no reason so  I don't remember what those situations I usually try not to remember when it happens I just I just let it go and just like the past of the past I tend not to look back  what do you mean  okay  at what I do to relax I like to run I like to go to the gym  listen to music a lot of Musician's Friend so I just I'm usually around musicians so anything of that sort I like I like everything from Lockhart to tattoos to just anything that's that's generally art and creative  who's been deposit  they just friends and general who received the we seem to do well and I think they are very inspiring and  which is sometimes a little bit tough and in a town like Los Angeles where I think everybody is on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't it's sometimes hard to find someone who is going to be uplifting or try to be inspiring so  I don't really have anybody in particular but people kind of brought up things here and there  yeah it's like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or egg you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just now I'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe I might I can do differently instead of just being negative thing hey don't do that that's no that's why you doing that it's a waste of time  I guess it depends on who you talk to  I'm okay at it I can probably work at that I don't know I mean I can I think I can do better  go back to the point about people provoking me so I mean I try not to blow Steam and let them get under my skin so I just usually try not to let it get to me but I don't know I guess what temper is it depends on how I handle my stress lately I've been better at it just because I think my situation has been a little bit better  now  now  no  nothing major and maybe when I was younger I could have traveled more I could have worked towards something that paid better job-wise but I mean those are all things that I think at any point in life you always think like why could have should have would have done but you know  but then again I think that's natural for anybody I mean I could I could have become a banker or I could have become a lawyer or doctor made. 10 times the money that I make now but but then again I don't like law and I don't like Madison so so it wasn't meant to be so  yeah  I think  I think my in my life I knew that there's a lot of things I have there's more things in life so I kind of narrowed it down to what am I good at and what am I not good at and what am I going to work well or who am I going to work well with and I not work well with so I kind of I kind of sort it out and then the list kind of  I'm kind of answered itself so  no it's I don't think it was hard but it was just but I think it was a real reality check and I think it's it's kind of a good thing cuz sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense it's like trying to shovel around peg into a square square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not going to go and so sometimes it just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you  memorable experiences  I think it's just I don't really have like anyone in particular I think I think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative I think it's just everything from getting it just the fact that  I got a job and I can I can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person as it sounds stupid but you know I think just the fact that I'm able I'm able to get this far in life without completely self-destructing is already in accomplishments so I feel like  I gotten somewhere  maybe not tonight maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire  yeah  I want the last time I really felt happy  I don't know I'm not really someone who is like  I don't have any real high highs or low lows I mean I haven't hit any Lowe's so I mean  I don't know I'm usually pretty I feel like I'm a level person and I'm pretty everyday I feel like if I accomplish one thing that I'm pretty happy so I guess the answer the question probably  probably yesterday I just feel like if I if I'm able to accomplish something then then hey I'm happy  no I don't really have a best friend but I mean well dance a question generally friends  I think they would say that I'm very outgoing I'm pretty

         "wow okay  when you're finished when she's done  okay  thank you  how are you doing today okay how about yourself  here in California  all well that is big and bras a lot to do a lot of  I'm job opportunities than other states pretty much that is big and it's a lot you can do here  traffic Maybe  the violence right the bad news even though you don't even want to know what's going on in your environment but you still have to watch it so you can you know look out to see what's going on on a daily basis  sociology I have a  2 year degree in Liberal Arts but my major was sociology  no I'm actually MTA bus operator  what's your  well since Metro is study growing my dream job is to move up in the company and I'm about to actually start some classes for supervisor free next week so cuz they look to promote within the company so that's a good thing is a lot of opportunities at Metro where you can take classes in their pay for your tuition and things of that nature  thanks  well it's not actually hard as right now is easy if you take advantage of it right now cuz they look to promote within so you know since I'm already working there that's a good thing so is good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible  what do you mean I'm sorry  okay  free take a long walk hot bath  meditate just close my eyes sometimes  okay  I'm pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you got to remain calm and still remain professional at the same time  well I look at it like it it goes with a Ami comes with experience you know you do something on a continuous basis usually you somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so I I look at it like that so I've been driving for years and dealing with the public so it's just how you handle circumstances how you treat people like you want to be treated  I'm pretty good at it now maybe when I were younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and I'm still learning today  I will say my family you know my kids so you know even though you don't have been having a lot of deaths around me but that's just that's part of the  life experience you know you born here but you got to leave here one day but  my kids will keep me you don't saying and you know I love them in my family  thank you  no  set good examples you know because you're the first teacher you know and you want to set a positive good example for your kids and I think that's a good thing and it starts at home  well  by you being the first teacher your kids you're that you're you're the one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they looking and learn everyday you know brother is that homeschool you know kids have a tendency to do things with a c you know what I mean so you try to keep it positive teaching good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature  I have a 4 1/2 year old son I have a seven-year-old daughter and I also have a 23 year old  yeah I'm about to be well my daughter's pregnant with the boy she has three little girls go have three grand kids and one on the way which is the boy this time  yeah thank you  the hardest thing is we're right now I'm a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and  they can be expensive at times you know and depends on the person's situation you know whether they have helped or job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you are trying to keep a job you know keep food in the house you know just maintaining support my kids the best way I can  with my kids or Just.  what's memorable for me is that I'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kind of like yeah it's kind of even though I'm the baby of 10 kids you know and I always kept in the back of my mind even though everybody will pretty much my whole family have decent job but I'm the one with the degree so I kind of like gave myself a pat on the back like you know you know I just that's the only thing I remember and graduating you know and my family is there to support me  thank you  happy that I accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just having a high school diploma and I had I was working on my bachelors degree but I ended up in a bad car accident I never went back I got distracted and you know I was working at the same time but I was just like more so I needed income then then I'm schooling at that time because I was a young parent you know cuz I have my daughter at 17 so I was like I made it the money to support her but I never went back but I feel like it's never too late so I feel like I take some classes now that I'm with Metro to help me move up the ladder so that's why I'm starting my class next week  thank you  well device I would have gave myself  then I probably would have been a young mother at a young age and that  I probably wouldn't  stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not I would have remained in school I probably would have had kids early you know  whether I probably would have stayed in school and probably have a part-time job or something just I just feel like education is an excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learn different things keep your mind open to learning new ideas every day so I think that's a plus you know and anybody shoes that's the better they sells you know through education maybe two maybe promote within your company or whatever the case maybe they help better your career  I'm quite sure you learn from your mistakes you know you but the same time you don't continue to make the same ones I feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know like myself even though I'm going to school late but still I'm going you know I want to better myself career-wise so  yes  my oldest daughter  we had an argument because  the life she's living right now in the things that she's going through and I had told her that she just need to make some changes to better her situation and I'll we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't want to hear it you know here's the stuff that you're saying even though  is true or  or they just you know quote they just don't want to hear it you know they may be going through something they don't want to hear but we got into argument about it but  lettuce happened you know  I just told her my I'm sorry  very close very close is that the situation my daughter's name right now she just needs to make some changes to better her her life  and I've been  she kind of like stubborn in their own way you know I was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom is not going to tell you nothing wrong and I've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's kind of like I was talking to a wall because she did the opposite and now she's she regretting it you know cuz she's like my mom told me that I'm doing the opposite so I guess you got a bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kind of like I didn't told you I left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change  how hot is it  it's very frustrating because it's like I'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me and I'm like it seems like it's taking forever for the change but it's left up to the individual when they're ready you know what I mean one supposed to get tired of something they make a change it may not be when you wanted to have him but  the ball is in her Court you know  only can do so much  oh wow  Oh my days  since I have two little ones my kind of like trying to go to bed at 8 because you know they got to go to school and I think it's important have a good night's rest because it kind of like  it it kind of like I guess you're ready for the next day or you know how you going to feel if you rested what type of person going to be that day you know cuz everybody have their days you know rather than good or bad but that's just part of life and I feel like if you had a good night good good night rest hopefully you have a good day you know  pretty much you know I need my rest because I'm out there driving a bus and dealing with all these people and you know the job is stuff is very stressful so I feel like if I'm rested and it helped me  what am I like irritated tired lazy  you know  feel like I want to lay down probably go to sleep  never thought about that you know  cuz like I said you know everybody had a moment to do  I thought about that  no  no  okay  how your best friend describe you I don't really have a best friend but person that I deal with it I used to work with she'll probably tell you that I'm very outgoing a go-getter Dependable responsible  I'm a people person  I get along with others you know I'm kind of like  I live in a good Mark  whether I know you are not if you was to you know like like you and I now you know I I I

         "yeah there's also on Craigslist so that's why okay  how are you doing today I'm doing good thank you  I'm from Los Angeles  I'm great  I live in West Los Angeles the west side  it's all right  I live alone so  I love it I'm from here so I grew up here it's natural  the weather on the weather  it's always good you never never bad there's always something to do really dull moment  traffic  the traffic is horrible I'll probably traffic is horrible in almost any major city but I hate the traffic  not really I mean I have enough things going on here so if I travel it's usually somewhere this within driving distance  I study business I didn't  no I've been done for a few years so I haven't gone to school for a while one of these days I'll go back to graduate school but  my dream job would be to just work for myself and make some money  I don't know I don't really have a dream job just something that I can I can work under my own terms and get paid decently and being a creative creative environment  I don't know I think it's just a matter of finding the right situation so right now at its people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they wanted it so it's a little tougher than it should be but I don't know I think when the situation is right I don't think it's too difficult  yep  I work as an administrative assistant through a temp agency so  I just basically has to get sent out to do to do desk jobs  yes or no I mean I feel like I feel like I could do more but now it works so  I'm pretty close there around so  I really mad  stupid people just basically doing doing anything to annoy me  that's because that's the big thing just irritating stupid people just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all  what's a good example  this random people who think it's funny that just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn't have to be one any specific situation it's just people who just think it's funny that I think they're just generally sadistic and they just think it's funny to it just probably like it's like poking a stick and an angry dog knowing that they know how they just want to push your buttons for no reason so  I don't remember what those situations I usually try not to remember when it happens I just I just let it go and just like the past of the past I tend not to look back  what do you mean  okay  at what I do to relax I like to run I like to go to the gym  listen to music a lot of Musician's Friend so I just I'm usually around musicians so anything of that sort I like I like everything from Lockhart to tattoos to just anything that's that's generally art and creative  who's been deposit  they just friends and general who received the we seem to do well and I think they are very inspiring and  which is sometimes a little bit tough and in a town like Los Angeles where I think everybody is on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't it's sometimes hard to find someone who is going to be uplifting or try to be inspiring so  I don't really have anybody in particular but people kind of brought up things here and there  yeah it's like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or egg you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just now I'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe I might I can do differently instead of just being negative thing hey don't do that that's no that's why you doing that it's a waste of time  I guess it depends on who you talk to  I'm okay at it I can probably work at that I don't know I mean I can I think I can do better  go back to the point about people provoking me so I mean I try not to blow Steam and let them get under my skin so I just usually try not to let it get to me but I don't know I guess what temper is it depends on how I handle my stress lately I've been better at it just because I think my situation has been a little bit better  now  now  no  nothing major and maybe when I was younger I could have traveled more I could have worked towards something that paid better job-wise but I mean those are all things that I think at any point in life you always think like why could have should have would have done but you know  but then again I think that's natural for anybody I mean I could I could have become a banker or I could have become a lawyer or doctor made. 10 times the money that I make now but but then again I don't like law and I don't like Madison so so it wasn't meant to be so  yeah  I think  I think my in my life I knew that there's a lot of things I have there's more things in life so I kind of narrowed it down to what am I good at and what am I not good at and what am I going to work well or who am I going to work well with and I not work well with so I kind of I kind of sort it out and then the list kind of  I'm kind of answered itself so  no it's I don't think it was hard but it was just but I think it was a real reality check and I think it's it's kind of a good thing cuz sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense it's like trying to shovel around peg into a square square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not going to go and so sometimes it just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you  memorable experiences  I think it's just I don't really have like anyone in particular I think I think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative I think it's just everything from getting it just the fact that  I got a job and I can I can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person as it sounds stupid but you know I think just the fact that I'm able I'm able to get this far in life without completely self-destructing is already in accomplishments so I feel like  I gotten somewhere  maybe not tonight maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire  yeah  I want the last time I really felt happy  I don't know I'm not really someone who is like  I don't have any real high highs or low lows I mean I haven't hit any Lowe's so I mean  I don't know I'm usually pretty I feel like I'm a level person and I'm pretty everyday I feel like if I accomplish one thing that I'm pretty happy so I guess the answer the question probably  probably yesterday I just feel like if I if I'm able to accomplish something then then hey I'm happy  no I don't really have a best friend but I mean well dance a question generally friends  I think they would say that I'm very outgoing I'm pretty determined  I'm trying now I tried I try to interact as much as possible I'm always out networking as much as possible so  I don't know I guess that's basically what I think they would describe me is  okay  no problem  all right  I was weird  play unplugged toaster",

         "wow okay  when you're finished when she's done  okay  thank you  how are you doing today okay how about yourself  here in California  all well that is big and bras a lot to do a lot of  I'm job opportunities than other states pretty much that is big and it's a lot you can do here  traffic Maybe  the violence right the bad news even though you don't even want to know what's going on in your environment but you still have to watch it so you can you know look out to see what's going on on a daily basis  sociology I have a  2 year degree in Liberal Arts but my major was sociology  no I'm actually MTA bus operator  what's your  well since Metro is study growing my dream job is to move up in the company and I'm about to actually start some classes for supervisor free next week so cuz they look to promote within the company so that's a good thing is a lot of opportunities at Metro where you can take classes in their pay for your tuition and things of that nature  thanks  well it's not actually hard as right now is easy if you take advantage of it right now cuz they look to promote within so you know since I'm already working there that's a good thing so is good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible  what do you mean I'm sorry  okay  free take a long walk hot bath  meditate just close my eyes sometimes  okay  I'm pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you got to remain calm and still remain professional at the same time  well I look at it like it it goes with a Ami comes with experience you know you do something on a continuous basis usually you somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so I I look at it like that so I've been driving for years and dealing with the public so it's just how you handle circumstances how you treat people like you want to be treated  I'm pretty good at it now maybe when I were younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and I'm still learning today  I will say my family you know my kids so you know even though you don't have been having a lot of deaths around me but that's just that's part of the  life experience you know you born here but you got to leave here one day but  my kids will keep me you don't saying and you know I love them in my family  thank you  no  set good examples you know because you're the first teacher you know and you want to set a positive good example for your kids and I think that's a good thing and it starts at home  well  by you being the first teacher your kids you're that you're you're the one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they looking and learn everyday you know brother is that homeschool you know kids have a tendency to do things with a c you know what I mean so you try to keep it positive teaching good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature  I have a 4 1/2 year old son I have a seven-year-old daughter and I also have a 23 year old  yeah I'm about to be well my daughter's pregnant with the boy she has three little girls go have three grand kids and one on the way which is the boy this time  yeah thank you  the hardest thing is we're right now I'm a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and  they can be expensive at times you know and depends on the person's situation you know whether they have helped or job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you are trying to keep a job you know keep food in the house you know just maintaining support my kids the best way I can  with my kids or Just.  what's memorable for me is that I'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kind of like yeah it's kind of even though I'm the baby of 10 kids you know and I always kept in the back of my mind even though everybody will pretty much my whole family have decent job but I'm the one with the degree so I kind of like gave myself a pat on the back like you know you know I just that's the only thing I remember and graduating you know and my family is there to support me  thank you  happy that I accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just having a high school diploma and I had I was working on my bachelors degree but I ended up in a bad car accident I never went back I got distracted and you know I was working at the same time but I was just like more so I needed income then then I'm schooling at that time because I was a young parent you know cuz I have my daughter at 17 so I was like I made it the money to support her but I never went back but I feel like it's never too late so I feel like I take some classes now that I'm with Metro to help me move up the ladder so that's why I'm starting my class next week  thank you  well device I would have gave myself  then I probably would have been a young mother at a young age and that  I probably wouldn't  stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not I would have remained in school I probably would have had kids early you know  whether I probably would have stayed in school and probably have a part-time job or something just I just feel like education is an excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learn different things keep your mind open to learning new ideas every day so I think that's a plus you know and anybody shoes that's the better they sells you know through education maybe two maybe promote within your company or whatever the case maybe they help better your career  I'm quite sure you learn from your mistakes you know you but the same time you don't continue to make the same ones I feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know like myself even though I'm going to school late but still I'm going you know I want to better myself career-wise so  yes  my oldest daughter  we had an argument because  the life she's living right now in the things that she's going through and I had told her that she just need to make some changes to better her situation and I'll we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't want to hear it you know here's the stuff that you're saying even though  is true or  or they just you know quote they just don't want to hear it you know they may be going through something they don't want to hear but we got into argument about it but  lettuce happened you know  I just told her my I'm sorry  very close very close is that the situation my daughter's name right now she just needs to make some changes to better her her life  and I've been  she kind of like stubborn in their own way you know I was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom is not going to tell you nothing wrong and I've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's kind of like I was talking to a wall because she did the opposite and now she's she regretting it you know cuz she's like my mom told me that I'm doing the opposite so I guess you got a bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kind of like I didn't told you I left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change  how hot is it  it's very frustrating because it's like I'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me and I'm like it seems like it's taking forever for the change but it's left up to the individual when they're ready you know what I mean one supposed to get tired of something they make a change it may not be when you wanted to have him but  the ball is in her Court you know  only can do so much  oh wow  Oh my days  since I have two little ones my kind of like trying to go to bed at 8 because you know they got to go to school and I think it's important have a good night's rest because it kind of like  it it kind of like I guess you're ready for the next day or you know how you going to feel if you rested what type of person going to be that day you know cuz everybody have their days you know rather than good or bad but that's just part of life and I feel like if you had a good night good good night rest hopefully you have a good day you know  pretty much you know I need my rest because I'm out there driving a bus and dealing with all these people and you know the job is stuff is very stressful so I feel like if I'm rested and it helped me  what am I like irritated tired lazy  you know  feel like I want to lay down probably go to sleep  never thought about that you know  cuz like I said you know everybody had a moment to do  I thought about that  no  no  okay  how your best friend describe you I don't really have a best friend but person that I deal with it I used to work with she'll probably tell you that I'm very outgoing a go-getter Dependable responsible  I'm a people person  I get along with others you know I'm kind of like  I live in a good Mark  whether I know you are not if you was to you know like like you and I now you know I I I

         "yeah there's also on Craigslist so that's why okay  how are you doing today I'm doing good thank you  I'm from Los Angeles  I'm great  I live in West Los Angeles the west side  it's all right  I live alone so  I love it I'm from here so I grew up here it's natural  the weather on the weather  it's always good you never never bad there's always something to do really dull moment  traffic  the traffic is horrible I'll probably traffic is horrible in almost any major city but I hate the traffic  not really I mean I have enough things going on here so if I travel it's usually somewhere this within driving distance  I study business I didn't  no I've been done for a few years so I haven't gone to school for a while one of these days I'll go back to graduate school but  my dream job would be to just work for myself and make some money  I don't know I don't really have a dream job just something that I can I can work under my own terms and get paid decently and being a creative creative environment  I don't know I think it's just a matter of finding the right situation so right now at its people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they wanted it so it's a little tougher than it should be but I don't know I think when the situation is right I don't think it's too difficult  yep  I work as an administrative assistant through a temp agency so  I just basically has to get sent out to do to do desk jobs  yes or no I mean I feel like I feel like I could do more but now it works so  I'm pretty close there around so  I really mad  stupid people just basically doing doing anything to annoy me  that's because that's the big thing just irritating stupid people just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all  what's a good example  this random people who think it's funny that just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn't have to be one any specific situation it's just people who just think it's funny that I think they're just generally sadistic and they just think it's funny to it just probably like it's like poking a stick and an angry dog knowing that they know how they just want to push your buttons for no reason so  I don't remember what those situations I usually try not to remember when it happens I just I just let it go and just like the past of the past I tend not to look back  what do you mean  okay  at what I do to relax I like to run I like to go to the gym  listen to music a lot of Musician's Friend so I just I'm usually around musicians so anything of that sort I like I like everything from Lockhart to tattoos to just anything that's that's generally art and creative  who's been deposit  they just friends and general who received the we seem to do well and I think they are very inspiring and  which is sometimes a little bit tough and in a town like Los Angeles where I think everybody is on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't it's sometimes hard to find someone who is going to be uplifting or try to be inspiring so  I don't really have anybody in particular but people kind of brought up things here and there  yeah it's like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or egg you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just now I'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe I might I can do differently instead of just being negative thing hey don't do that that's no that's why you doing that it's a waste of time  I guess it depends on who you talk to  I'm okay at it I can probably work at that I don't know I mean I can I think I can do better  go back to the point about people provoking me so I mean I try not to blow Steam and let them get under my skin so I just usually try not to let it get to me but I don't know I guess what temper is it depends on how I handle my stress lately I've been better at it just because I think my situation has been a little bit better  now  now  no  nothing major and maybe when I was younger I could have traveled more I could have worked towards something that paid better job-wise but I mean those are all things that I think at any point in life you always think like why could have should have would have done but you know  but then again I think that's natural for anybody I mean I could I could have become a banker or I could have become a lawyer or doctor made. 10 times the money that I make now but but then again I don't like law and I don't like Madison so so it wasn't meant to be so  yeah  I think  I think my in my life I knew that there's a lot of things I have there's more things in life so I kind of narrowed it down to what am I good at and what am I not good at and what am I going to work well or who am I going to work well with and I not work well with so I kind of I kind of sort it out and then the list kind of  I'm kind of answered itself so  no it's I don't think it was hard but it was just but I think it was a real reality check and I think it's it's kind of a good thing cuz sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense it's like trying to shovel around peg into a square square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not going to go and so sometimes it just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you  memorable experiences  I think it's just I don't really have like anyone in particular I think I think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative I think it's just everything from getting it just the fact that  I got a job and I can I can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person as it sounds stupid but you know I think just the fact that I'm able I'm able to get this far in life without completely self-destructing is already in accomplishments so I feel like  I gotten somewhere  maybe not tonight maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire  yeah  I want the last time I really felt happy  I don't know I'm not really someone who is like  I don't have any real high highs or low lows I mean I haven't hit any Lowe's so I mean  I don't know I'm usually pretty I feel like I'm a level person and I'm pretty everyday I feel like if I accomplish one thing that I'm pretty happy so I guess the answer the question probably  probably yesterday I just feel like if I if I'm able to accomplish something then then hey I'm happy  no I don't really have a best friend but I mean well dance a question generally friends  I think they would say that I'm very outgoing I'm pretty

         "wow okay  when you're finished when she's done  okay  thank you  how are you doing today okay how about yourself  here in California  all well that is big and bras a lot to do a lot of  I'm job opportunities than other states pretty much that is big and it's a lot you can do here  traffic Maybe  the violence right the bad news even though you don't even want to know what's going on in your environment but you still have to watch it so you can you know look out to see what's going on on a daily basis  sociology I have a  2 year degree in Liberal Arts but my major was sociology  no I'm actually MTA bus operator  what's your  well since Metro is study growing my dream job is to move up in the company and I'm about to actually start some classes for supervisor free next week so cuz they look to promote within the company so that's a good thing is a lot of opportunities at Metro where you can take classes in their pay for your tuition and things of that nature  thanks  well it's not actually hard as right now is easy if you take advantage of it right now cuz they look to promote within so you know since I'm already working there that's a good thing so is good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible  what do you mean I'm sorry  okay  free take a long walk hot bath  meditate just close my eyes sometimes  okay  I'm pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you got to remain calm and still remain professional at the same time  well I look at it like it it goes with a Ami comes with experience you know you do something on a continuous basis usually you somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so I I look at it like that so I've been driving for years and dealing with the public so it's just how you handle circumstances how you treat people like you want to be treated  I'm pretty good at it now maybe when I were younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and I'm still learning today  I will say my family you know my kids so you know even though you don't have been having a lot of deaths around me but that's just that's part of the  life experience you know you born here but you got to leave here one day but  my kids will keep me you don't saying and you know I love them in my family  thank you  no  set good examples you know because you're the first teacher you know and you want to set a positive good example for your kids and I think that's a good thing and it starts at home  well  by you being the first teacher your kids you're that you're you're the one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they looking and learn everyday you know brother is that homeschool you know kids have a tendency to do things with a c you know what I mean so you try to keep it positive teaching good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature  I have a 4 1/2 year old son I have a seven-year-old daughter and I also have a 23 year old  yeah I'm about to be well my daughter's pregnant with the boy she has three little girls go have three grand kids and one on the way which is the boy this time  yeah thank you  the hardest thing is we're right now I'm a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and  they can be expensive at times you know and depends on the person's situation you know whether they have helped or job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you are trying to keep a job you know keep food in the house you know just maintaining support my kids the best way I can  with my kids or Just.  what's memorable for me is that I'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kind of like yeah it's kind of even though I'm the baby of 10 kids you know and I always kept in the back of my mind even though everybody will pretty much my whole family have decent job but I'm the one with the degree so I kind of like gave myself a pat on the back like you know you know I just that's the only thing I remember and graduating you know and my family is there to support me  thank you  happy that I accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just having a high school diploma and I had I was working on my bachelors degree but I ended up in a bad car accident I never went back I got distracted and you know I was working at the same time but I was just like more so I needed income then then I'm schooling at that time because I was a young parent you know cuz I have my daughter at 17 so I was like I made it the money to support her but I never went back but I feel like it's never too late so I feel like I take some classes now that I'm with Metro to help me move up the ladder so that's why I'm starting my class next week  thank you  well device I would have gave myself  then I probably would have been a young mother at a young age and that  I probably wouldn't  stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not I would have remained in school I probably would have had kids early you know  whether I probably would have stayed in school and probably have a part-time job or something just I just feel like education is an excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learn different things keep your mind open to learning new ideas every day so I think that's a plus you know and anybody shoes that's the better they sells you know through education maybe two maybe promote within your company or whatever the case maybe they help better your career  I'm quite sure you learn from your mistakes you know you but the same time you don't continue to make the same ones I feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know like myself even though I'm going to school late but still I'm going you know I want to better myself career-wise so  yes  my oldest daughter  we had an argument because  the life she's living right now in the things that she's going through and I had told her that she just need to make some changes to better her situation and I'll we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't want to hear it you know here's the stuff that you're saying even though  is true or  or they just you know quote they just don't want to hear it you know they may be going through something they don't want to hear but we got into argument about it but  lettuce happened you know  I just told her my I'm sorry  very close very close is that the situation my daughter's name right now she just needs to make some changes to better her her life  and I've been  she kind of like stubborn in their own way you know I was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom is not going to tell you nothing wrong and I've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's kind of like I was talking to a wall because she did the opposite and now she's she regretting it you know cuz she's like my mom told me that I'm doing the opposite so I guess you got a bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kind of like I didn't told you I left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change  how hot is it  it's very frustrating because it's like I'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me and I'm like it seems like it's taking forever for the change but it's left up to the individual when they're ready you know what I mean one supposed to get tired of something they make a change it may not be when you wanted to have him but  the ball is in her Court you know  only can do so much  oh wow  Oh my days  since I have two little ones my kind of like trying to go to bed at 8 because you know they got to go to school and I think it's important have a good night's rest

their days you know rather than good or bad but that's just part of life and I feel like if you had a good night good good night rest hopefully you have a good day you know  pretty much you know I need my rest because I'm out there driving a bus and dealing with all these people and you know the job is stuff is very stressful so I feel like if I'm rested and it helped me  what am I like

         "yeah there's also on Craigslist so that's why okay  how are you doing today I'm doing good thank you  I'm from Los Angeles  I'm great  I live in West Los Angeles the west side  it's all right  I live alone so  I love it I'm from here so I grew up here it's natural  the weather on the weather  it's always good you never never bad there's always something to do really dull moment  traffic  the traffic is horrible I'll probably traffic is horrible in almost any major city but I hate the traffic  not really I mean I have enough things going on here so if I travel it's usually somewhere this within driving distance  I study business I didn't  no I've been done for a few years so I haven't gone to school for a while one of these days I'll go back to graduate school but  my dream job would be to just work for myself and make some money  I don't know I don't really have a dream job just something that I can I can work under my own terms and get paid decently and being a creative creative environment  I don't know I think it's just a matter of finding the right situation so right now at its people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they wanted it so it's a little tougher than it should be but I don't know I think when the situation is right I don't think it's too difficult  yep  I work as an administrative assistant through a temp agency so  I just basically has to get sent out to do to do desk jobs  yes or no I mean I feel like I feel like I could do more but now it works so  I'm pretty close there around so  I really mad  stupid people just basically doing doing anything to annoy me  that's because that's the big thing just irritating stupid people just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all  what's a good example  this random people who think it's funny that just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn't have to be one any specific situation it's just people who just think it's funny that I think they're just generally sadistic and they just think it's funny to it just probably like it's like poking a stick and an angry dog knowing that they know how they just want to push your buttons for no reason so  I don't remember what those situations I usually try not to remember when it happens I just I just let it go and just like the past of the past I tend not to look back  what do you mean  okay  at what I do to relax I like to run I like to go to the gym  listen to music a lot of Musician's Friend so I just I'm usually around musicians so anything of that sort I like I like everything from Lockhart to tattoos to just anything that's that's generally art and creative  who's been deposit  they just friends and general who received the we seem to do well and I think they are very inspiring and  which is sometimes a little bit tough and in a town like Los Angeles where I think everybody is on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't it's sometimes hard to find someone who is going to be uplifting or try to be inspiring so  I don't really have anybody in particular but people kind of brought up things here and there  yeah it's like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or egg you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just now I'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe I might I can do differently instead of just being negative thing hey don't do that that's no that's why you doing that it's a waste of time  I guess it depends on who you talk to  I'm okay at it I can probably work at that I don't know I mean I can I think I can do better  go back to the point about people provoking me so I mean I try not to blow Steam and let them get under my skin so I just usually try not to let it get to me but I don't know I guess what temper is it depends on how I handle my stress lately I've been better at it just because I think my situation has been a little bit better  now  now  no  nothing major and maybe when I was younger I could have traveled more I could have worked towards something that paid better job-wise but I mean those are all things that I think at any point in life you always think like why could have should have would have done but you know  but then again I think that's natural for anybody I mean I could I could have become a banker or I could have become a lawyer or doctor made. 10 times the money that I make now but but then again I don't like law and I don't like Madison so so it wasn't meant to be so  yeah  I think  I think my in my life I knew that there's a lot of things I have there's more things in life so I kind of narrowed it down to what am I good at and what am I not good at and what am I going to work well or who am I going to work well with and I not work well with so I kind of I kind of sort it out and then the list kind of  I'm kind of answered itself so  no it's I don't think it was hard but it was just but I think it was a real reality check and I think it's it's kind of a good thing cuz sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense it's like trying to shovel around peg into a square square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not going to go and so sometimes it just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you  memorable experiences  I think it's just I don't really have like anyone in particular I think I think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative I think it's just everything from getting it just the fact that  I got a job and I can I can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person as it sounds stupid but you know I think just the fact that I'm able I'm able to get this far in life without completely self-destructing is already in accomplishments so I feel like  I gotten somewhere  maybe not tonight maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire  yeah  I want the last time I really felt happy  I don't know I'm not really someone who is like  I don't have any real high highs or low lows I mean I haven't hit any Lowe's so I mean  I don't know I'm usually pretty I feel like I'm a level person and I'm pretty everyday I feel like if I accomplish one thing that I'm pretty happy so I guess the answer the question probably  probably yesterday I just feel like if I if I'm able to accomplish something then then hey I'm happy  no I don't really have a best friend but I mean well dance a question generally friends  I think they would say that I'm very outgoing I'm pretty

         "wow okay  when you're finished when she's done  okay  thank you  how are you doing today okay how about yourself  here in California  all well that is big and bras a lot to do a lot of  I'm job opportunities than other states pretty much that is big and it's a lot you can do here  traffic Maybe  the violence right the bad news even though you don't even want to know what's going on in your environment but you still have to watch it so you can you know look out to see what's going on on a daily basis  sociology I have a  2 year degree in Liberal Arts but my major was sociology  no I'm actually MTA bus operator  what's your  well since Metro is study growing my dream job is to move up in the company and I'm about to actually start some classes for supervisor free next week so cuz they look to promote within the company so that's a good thing is a lot of opportunities at Metro where you can take classes in their pay for your tuition and things of that nature  thanks  well it's not actually hard as right now is easy if you take advantage of it right now cuz they look to promote within so you know since I'm already working there that's a good thing so is good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible  what do you mean I'm sorry  okay  free take a long walk hot bath  meditate just close my eyes sometimes  okay  I'm pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you got to remain calm and still remain professional at the same time  well I look at it like it it goes with a Ami comes with experience you know you do something on a continuous basis usually you somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so I I look at it like that so I've been driving for years and dealing with the public so it's just how you handle circumstances how you treat people like you want to be treated  I'm pretty good at it now maybe when I were younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and I'm still learning today  I will say my family you know my kids so you know even though you don't have been having a lot of deaths around me but that's just that's part of the  life experience you know you born here but you got to leave here one day but  my kids will keep me you don't saying and you know I love them in my family  thank you  no  set good examples you know because you're the first teacher you know and you want to set a positive good example for your kids and I think that's a good thing and it starts at home  well  by you being the first teacher your kids you're that you're you're the one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they looking and learn everyday you know brother is that homeschool you know kids have a tendency to do things with a c you know what I mean so you try to keep it positive teaching good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature  I have a 4 1/2 year old son I have a seven-year-old daughter and I also have a 23 year old  yeah I'm about to be well my daughter's pregnant with the boy she has three little girls go have three grand kids and one on the way which is the boy this time  yeah thank you  the hardest thing is we're right now I'm a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and  they can be expensive at times you know and depends on the person's situation you know whether they have helped or job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you are trying to keep a job you know keep food in the house you know just maintaining support my kids the best way I can  with my kids or Just.  what's memorable for me is that I'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kind of like yeah it's kind of even though I'm the baby of 10 kids you know and I always kept in the back of my mind even though everybody will pretty much my whole family have decent job but I'm the one with the degree so I kind of like gave myself a pat on the back like you know you know I just that's the only thing I remember and graduating you know and my family is there to support me  thank you  happy that I accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just having a high school diploma and I had I was working on my bachelors degree but I ended up in a bad car accident I never went back I got distracted and you know I was working at the same time but I was just like more so I needed income then then I'm schooling at that time because I was a young parent you know cuz I have my daughter at 17 so I was like I made it the money to support her but I never went back but I feel like it's never too late so I feel like I take some classes now that I'm with Metro to help me move up the ladder so that's why I'm starting my class next week  thank you  well device I would have gave myself  then I probably would have been a young mother at a young age and that  I probably wouldn't  stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not I would have remained in school I probably would have had kids early you know  whether I probably would have stayed in school and probably have a part-time job or something just I just feel like education is an excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learn different things keep your mind open to learning new ideas every day so I think that's a plus you know and anybody shoes that's the better they sells you know through education maybe two maybe promote within your company or whatever the case maybe they help better your career  I'm quite sure you learn from your mistakes you know you but the same time you don't continue to make the same ones I feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know like myself even though I'm going to school late but still I'm going you know I want to better myself career-wise so  yes  my oldest daughter  we had an argument because  the life she's living right now in the things that she's going through and I had told her that she just need to make some changes to better her situation and I'll we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't want to hear it you know here's the stuff that you're saying even though  is true or  or they just you know quote they just don't want to hear it you know they may be going through something they don't want to hear but we got into argument about it but  lettuce happened you know  I just told her my I'm sorry  very close very close is that the situation my daughter's name right now she just needs to make some changes to better her her life  and I've been  she kind of like stubborn in their own way you know I was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom is not going to tell you nothing wrong and I've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's kind of like I was talking to a wall because she did the opposite and now she's she regretting it you know cuz she's like my mom told me that I'm doing the opposite so I guess you got a bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kind of like I didn't told you I left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change  how hot is it  it's very frustrating because it's like I'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me and I'm like it seems like it's taking forever for the change but it's left up to the individual when they're ready you know what I mean one supposed to get tired of something they make a change it may not be when you wanted to have him but  the ball is in her Court you know  only can do so much  oh wow  Oh my days  since I have two little ones my kind of like trying to go to bed at 8 because you know they got to go to school and I think it's important have a good night's rest

their days you know rather than good or bad but that's just part of life and I feel like if you had a good night good good night rest hopefully you have a good day you know  pretty much you know I need my rest because I'm out there driving a bus and dealing with all these people and you know the job is stuff is very stressful so I feel like if I'm rested and it helped me  what am I like
